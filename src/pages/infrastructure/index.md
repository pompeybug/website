Portsmouth Cycle Forum is constantly campaigning for better cycling infrastructure in Portsmouth. Our current major campaigns are:

* The Portsmouth Cycle Forum Manifesto is [here](/public/assets/docs/2012-pcf-manifesto.pdf).
* Seafront Cycle Route – PCF supports the cycle route currently being installed between Eastney and South Parade Pier and is campaigning for phase 2 to be approved and installed.  To read our Q&A on the seafront cycle route and to find out how to support the route go to our [Seafront Cycle Route](/infrastructure/seafront-cycle-route/) page.
* Strategic Cycle Routes – PCF is campaigning for better North-South routes in and out of the city.  Read our [Strategic Cycle Routes](/infrastructure/strategic-cycle-routes/) page.
