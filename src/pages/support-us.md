Membership of Portsmouth Cycle Forum is **free**, because we want to encourage as many cyclists as we can to engage with our campaign. However, any campaign has some costs and the cycle forum is no different.

If you’d like to make a donation to support our campaign we would very, very much appreciate your generosity. This will help us to cover costs such as printing, postage, event fees and web-related fees.

You can [donate to us via _Sumup_](https://pay.sumup.io/b2c/QHGTB2DU) using any credit or debit card.  We understand that money is tight and we genuinely appreciate every penny.

Many thanks!
