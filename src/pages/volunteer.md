Have you considered volunteering?  Portsmouth Cycle Forum is *entirely* run by volunteers!  There are many things **you** could do to help.

We have many tasks, from one-off small jobs that we'd love to get done but don't have time, to large scale projects that need management and contributions.

For example
 * here's the [list of website articles](/todos) that need checking for outdated links and other small niggles.
 * here's a [list of technical website issues](https://github.com/pompeybug/website/issues) that are currently waiting to be worked on.
 
If you'd like to help just [let us know](/contact)!

...or if you're technical, just fork [the repo](https://github.com/pompeybug/website), tackle an issue and send us a PR :-)
