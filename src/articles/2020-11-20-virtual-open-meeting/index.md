The first public meeting of the Portsmouth Cycle Forum since October 2019. How did you find cycling in Portsmouth during 2020?

## About this Event

We had great plans for 2020 which were thrown out in Spring as the weather started getting better, but lockdown meant we could not gather in person.

As a result more people were cycling around the city, and national funding pots were developed to assist in capturing behaviour change and making road conditions safer for those choosing active travel during the pandemic.

Roads were closed to motor traffic with people walking and cycling considered more than previously as working, travel and exercising patterns changed to meet 'the new normal'.

- How successful was Portsmouth City Council?
- What part did PCF play in the development of schemes?
- What do you want to see more of in the future?
- Will the recent consultations really create 'A City To Share'?

 

We will be meeting virtually via the Zoom platform and would like to hear about your experiences of 2020, and how we build moving forward in the next year.

Whether you are a member or not, please register your interest to ensure you receive the connection details ahead of the meeting and ensure you have a place as we have a limited number of places.
