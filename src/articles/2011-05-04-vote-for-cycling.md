![Electoral Ballot Box](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Electoral-Ballot-Box--185x300.jpg "Electoral Ballot Box")Vote for bikes, more fun and freedom, fresh air, health - for almost free! Its local election time and here is the result of our own electioneering.

Portsmouth Cycle Forum sent [this manifesto](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/pcf-manifesto.pdf "PCF Manifesto") to all of the 51 candidates in 14 Portsmouth wards.  We received replies from candidates in 7 wards, Baffins, Central Southsea, Charles Cickens, Cosham, Fratton, Hilsea and Milton.  We have received enthusiastic support from 3 Labour candidates, 3 Conservatives, 1 Green candidate and 1 from the Trade Unionist and Socialist Coalition. We have one acknowledgement from the Liberal Democrat party.  So 7 of our wards have candidates apparently uninterested in this manifesto. The liberal democrats are markedly under-represented in our 11% response rate.

Where will you put your cross?
