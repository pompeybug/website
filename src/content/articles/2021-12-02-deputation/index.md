## Agenda item 4: Speed and casualty Reduction Measures

Portsmouth Cycle Forum obviously support the aim to improve safety for all road users in the city.

With the road casualty figures for 2020 having been released recently, it is
encouraging that the number of cycle casualties on the authority’s roads have
decreased around 18%, however we will only discover how reduced traffic
levels during the pandemic has affected these statistics when the 2021 data is
released next autumn. According to PCC cycle count data, we know that there
were many fewer rush-hour commuter cycle trips being made last year, even
though the total number trips around the city was up, as many people took to
bicycles for exercise following Government health advice.

The trial of the Elm Grove / Kings Road segregated cycle lanes last autumn
aligned with personal commitments that meant I could spend the hour
between 6pm and 7pm every Wednesday evening standing at the Elm Grove /
Grove Road junction counting the number of the people cycling through the
junction in all directions.

Over 11 weeks the average number of trips per minute during that hour was
1.18. The only week that dropped below 1 trip per minute was on 16 th
December.

The fact that the report highlights this single junction was also responsible for
a total of five cycle casualties in 2019 &amp; 2020 from a total of 291 across the
whole city in the same period, clearly shows the need for an improved design.

During my 11 hours observing, it was also clear that the junction does not
protect cyclists, especially those exiting from Grove Road North, the only arm
of the junction that does not have an advanced stop line for cyclists or perhaps
more importantly is also missing the low-level early-release cycle signals.

This last point means that cyclists travelling south or west are placed into
direct conflict with motor vehicle traffic exiting Grove Road South at the same
time and who may be travelling north or east and therefore creating the very
situation highlighted in the report of a motor vehicle turning across the path of
a cyclist. I witnessed a number of these incidents last year and the issue has
also been highlighted to us by members. We always request that they report
such issues to the Council’s near miss reporting tool to ensure the relevant
data is there to be drawn upon in future.

We would therefore request that as part of this scheme a dedicated early
release cycle phase signal is added to the Grove Road North exit to allow
people cycling to get further into the main part of the junction earlier and thus
be more visible to motor vehicles now moving off later.

The cycle early release signal timings, both here and around the city, should
also be examined to ensure they meet the guidance as set out in Local
Transport Note 1/20 section 10.6.40 which states:

> "an early start phase of 4 seconds gives cyclists good priority without unduly delaying traffic. An early start phase of less than 3 seconds is not recommended."

Incidentally, we have discovered this summer that the issue of junctions
without a full complement early-release cycle phase signals is a trend across
the city. Other sites we have identified are:
* Lake Road’s right turn into Kingston Road
* St Mary’s Rd right turn Towards Kingston Rd / Lake Rd junction
* Copnor Road northbound at Burrfields Road junction.

Additionally, it was noted on my counts last year that at night, the light levels
at the junction in Elm Grove are pretty poor, as there are no lamp posts
situated within the area inside controlled crossing points, and therefore a good
25 metres away from the centre of the junction. The addition of high buildings
on three of the four corners exacerbates this problem, with the Grove Road
North arm being particularly affected and the darkest. I remember being told
during my driving lessons that the more lights at a location, the more
awareness you needed to have as a road user. Even an additional street light
closer to the junction might make a fundamental difference to general
visibility.

Finally, we would like to address the issue around the accessibility of the cycle
lanes and advance stop lines. The one improvement during last year’s trial
that all cyclists agreed about, was the fact that it effectively eliminated the
constant issue of cycle lane blocking in this location, but only when the posts
were not being deliberately removed to create space to park.

It has long been an issue with our members, and something we have reported
many times, as well as highlighting in the consultations around the design of
the trial scheme, that motor vehicles are free to park here blocking the cycle
lane with only a cursory and insignificant attempt to enforce the parking
restrictions.

With the abrupt and early removal of the trial, we hoped that perhaps the
protection of the cycle lane at this junction would be kept, as it was simply
enforcing the existing road space allocation as marked on the ground.

We can see how the new scheme installed at the same time along Ordnance
Row has developed to the point where there are now more permanent
bollards segregating and protecting the mandatory cycle lane there. That same
approach in Elm Grove a year ago, would have resulted in many cyclists
regarding the trial lanes as having some form of successful outcome.

We would like to see a similar approach taken here, where an existing and well
used cycle lane is protected to allow cyclists safe access to the junction, to take
advantage of the advance stop line and early-release lights, and experience the
benefit of being prioritised for using active travel and reducing motor vehicles
journeys within the city.

We would also like to point out that the Elm Grove / Kings Road route is also
outside of the clean air zone and has the potential to act as a conduit towards
the east of the city without travelling through the CAZ. This could well result in

an increase in traffic along this route and therefore an increase in danger
towards those people choosing more sustainable forms of travel.

To conclude Elm Grove / Grove Road junction does need improving. We
support the scheme to make changes to protect vulnerable road users, we
have both new ideas and previously submitted suggestions, and we are happy
to discuss these as detailed designs are further developed. However, we do
not believe that the assigned budget of £40,000 is sufficient given the required
scope of the project.

Briefly on the other measures on this agenda item, we welcome any form of
data collection that helps officers to identify locations for potential schemes,
monitor any changes following their implementation and report where they
have been successful, in turn identifying the approaches that can be taken on
future projects.
