We have a bumper edition of [the newsletter](/public/assets/docs/PCF-Newsletter-December-2010.pdf) to round off the year.  In it you'll find details of all forthcoming events, including the launch of  the Eastney family Bike club on 27 December.  We take a look at options for phase II of the seafront cycle route, plus news and views from around the country.
