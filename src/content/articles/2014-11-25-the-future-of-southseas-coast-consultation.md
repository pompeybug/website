**A CITY TO SHARE** includes accessibility for all to our coast and heritage. The proposed new flood defences for Southsea seafront present a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to complete a missing section of the seafront cycle.

Do you want a cycle route along the seafront between the two piers so that you and your family can cycle without fear of being squeezed or reversed into? The consultation has a question on cycling so it's important to respond.

See the link for details of the consultation roadshows or study the plans online. Don't forget to fill in the feedback form to answer that knotty question!

The consultation closes on 29 December 2014.
