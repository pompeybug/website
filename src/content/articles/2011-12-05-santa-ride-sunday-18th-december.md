[![Santa rRide](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/santa-ride-poster-pdf-200x151.jpg "Santa Ride")](/assets/santa-ride-poster-pdf-200x151.jpg)Our annual Christmas bike ride starts at the Stacey Community Centre where we will be joined by Santa for a short trip around Milton Common. We are dressing the bike  trailer up as a sled for Santa to use and in it will be a small gift for all children who come along. There's something for the adults who bring them too!

The Stacey Centre is in Walsall Road, Copnor (off Lichfield Road, off Langstone Road) PO3 6DN.
