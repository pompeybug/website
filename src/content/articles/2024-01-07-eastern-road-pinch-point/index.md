PCF approached the Coastal Defences team as work started on the latest part of the eastern defences to ask whether there might be scope to remove the low resting wall as part of their works in order to widen the shared-path which visibly narrows alongside the wall.

We’re glad to report it looks like this has been achieved, but we will follow up to confirm whether the lampost (with 50mph sign attached) will also be moved before the works complete later in 2024 to avoid it being positioned in the middle of the path.
