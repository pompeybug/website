Professor Dorling is advocating [the introduction of 20s nationwide](http://www.whatonechange.co.uk/adopt-a-20mph-speed-limit-in-residential-areas-danny-dorling/ "Danny Dorling") in residential streets. He uses Portsmouth as an example of an Authority that has taken this step. We feel that the true benefits of the 20s will be felt when this excellent initiative is promoted and enforced in the city. If all drivers in residential roads in Portsmouth stuck to 20, cyclists and pedestrians could feel safer and be safer.

Danny Dorling is an author and professor of Human Geography who has  dedicated his career to exposing the social costs of inequality. In his  response to the [What One Change](http://www.whatonechange.co.uk/ "what one change") question, Danny focuses on the [Twenty’s Plenty](http://www.20splentyforus.org.uk/ "20s plenty")[![picture of child design](/assets/20a-150x126.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/06/danny-dorling-backs-the-20s-and-portsmouth-gets-a-mention/20a/) campaign for 20mph speed limits in all residential areas. Having been  successfully adopted in several cities around the UK already, the  campaign has already reported an impressive reduction in road deaths and  serious injuries. However as a driver of broader social change, Danny  suggests that the campaign’s benefits go further still – from the  positive impact on our daily environment, to helping us re-engage with  our community and campaigning for the bigger changes we want.
