This coming Sunday 27th March is the fabulous Metropolis Ride

It starts in the Guildhall Square at 11am-3pm.

The route is mostly quiet roads or cycle routes and we will be going up to Queen Alexandra Hospital to look at the new buildings there. The ride will also be looking at lots of other interesting and imposing local architecture dotted around Portsmouth.

It is based on one of the Healthy Pompey themed ride leaflets and should be an interesting and enjoyable moderate distance ride.
