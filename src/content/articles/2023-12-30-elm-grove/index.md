At the December 2023 Transport Cabinet meeting there was a question about the progress of a road safety scheme for the Elm Grove / Grove Road junction for which funding has been approved but no scheme has been approved.

Two years ago PCF made a [deputation](/2021-12-02-deputation) to the <em>funding decision meeting</em> for this scheme, highlighting our concerns and suggestions for the junction.

As a recognised high casualty location for cyclists, **this needs to be addressed as a priority**.
