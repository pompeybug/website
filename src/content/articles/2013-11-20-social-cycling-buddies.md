Social Cycling Buddies is a new group Portsmouth, aiming to encourage cyclists of all levels to get out on bikes. Portsmouth Cycle Forum members are welcome to join their events which are listed on Facebook and on their website. The next event on 30 November. All rides are casual, and always involve food at some point.
