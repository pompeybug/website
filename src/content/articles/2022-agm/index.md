**Our 2022 Annual General Meeting will take place at 7.00pm on Thursday 24nd March.**

It is an opportunity to come and hear about what we are doing and voice your thoughts about what we should aim for in the next 12 months.

This year we would love to see you in person at the Sir Loin Of Beef in Eastney but we are also offering attendance via Zoom. All the details on how to register can be found on Eventbrite.

Non-members are welcome to join the meeting but must register no later than 24 hours before its start time. You are welcome to listen to the debate but cannot vote at the meeting. If you wish to become a member you can do so [**FOR FREE via this link**](/join/)
