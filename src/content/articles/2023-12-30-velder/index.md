The cycling infrastructure at the Velder Avenue junction has been improved after repeated requests from PCF over many years.

Alverstone Road features low-level cycle-phase lights with auto-acknowledgement, however this has been dogged by activation issues.  These problems have been solved by the addition of a push-button mechanism.

The original [idea for the cycle filter phase](/2013-06-15-tour-of-traffic-lights) was from former PCF Chair Jon Spencer.
