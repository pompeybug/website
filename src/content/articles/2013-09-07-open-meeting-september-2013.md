The next PCF open meeting will take place at 7pm on Thursday 12th September at The Learning Place.  We’ll be demonstrating Open Streetmap, the user-generated online mapping tool - this topic was deferred from the last meeting due to the discussion regarding the Fratton Way Tesco.  We'll also as well as talking about other important cycle-related issues, like the imminent Lord Mayor's bike ride and the changes to the one way system in Cosham.

###  Agenda

1.  Open Street Map
2.  Summer Fair and Lord Mayor's Bike Ride
3.  Local infrastructure report
4.  AOB
Please do come along - we’ll have access to a computer suite so you can get interactive with cycle mapping! Do come along – food and refreshments will be available.

We'd like to make the session on Open Street Map as interactive as possible - there are computers available to use but if you'd like to bring your own laptop then please do.  It is a powerful tool for creating and distributing free geographic data.  This should prove extremely useful for mapping cycle infrastructure that is rarely featured accurately on standard maps.

The Learning Place is located at 6 Derby Road, North End. Portsmouth PO2 8HH - you can find a map [here](http://goo.gl/qaoh9d "The Learning Place").
