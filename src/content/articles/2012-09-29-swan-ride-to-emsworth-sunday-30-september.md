We are off on our end of month ride again this Sunday 30 September..

Meeting at Canoe Lake, Southsea at 10am.

We'll be sticking to mostly cycle ways following the seafront cycle route to take the Hayling Ferry across the harbour, along the Billy-Trail to Langstone then cycle to Emsworth to visit the Mill Pond swans.

You can either ride back or catch the train home from Emsworth station.

Starts at 10:00 - see you there!

And don't forget the ** WEDNESDAY MORNING BIKE RIDE ** on 3 October. Meet at Stacey Centre, Walsall Rd from 10.15 am. Rides will start at 10.30, last for about 2 hours and include a stop for coffee.
