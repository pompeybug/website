The Community Cycling Centre is offering it’s first Adopt a Bike Day on Saturday 7 May from 12 to 2 at the Stacey Centre, Walsall Road, Copnor, PO3 6DN.

We have a selection of refurbished child, youth and adult bicycles which we will give away in exchange for a donation to cover our costs.

If you have a old bike languishing in your garden shed that you’d like to donate to our not-for-profit project then we’d be pleased to hear from you.

The Community Cycle Centre is managed by Portsmouth Cycle Forum.
