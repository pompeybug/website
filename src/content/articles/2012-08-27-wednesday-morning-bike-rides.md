Rides start at the Stacey Community Centre in Walsall Road, Copnor (near St Mary's Hospital) and there is always a stop for coffee stop either en-route on the way.

The  rides are on the first and third Wednesdays of each month (and not as stated in a recent press article). Dates for the next two months are: 5 September, 19 September, 3 October, 17 October.
