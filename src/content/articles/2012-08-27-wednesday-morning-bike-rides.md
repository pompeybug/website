The Wednesday morning bike rides give the opportunity to meet people and explore Portsmouth's quieter streets and cycle routes. Rides start at the Stacey Community Centre in Walsall Road, Copnor (near St Mary's Hospital) and there is always a stop for coffee stop either en-route on the way.

The  rides are on the first and third Wednesdays of each month (and not as stated in a recent press article). Dates for the next two months are: 5 September, 19 September, 3 October, 17 October.
