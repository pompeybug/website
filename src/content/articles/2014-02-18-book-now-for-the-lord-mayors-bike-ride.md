Bookings are open for the Lord Mayor's Charity Bike Ride which takes place on Sunday 23 March from Victoria Park in central Portsmouth.


Entrants can choose from a selection of two rides depending on ability; the Half Island Ride is a fun bike ride for all the family to enjoy, or for the more advanced cyclists, the Full Island Ride which takes in spectacular views along the coast.

All proceeds form the ride will be donated to the Lord Mayor's Appeal fund which, this year, is supporting Brain Tumour Research, Portsmouth Young Carers and the Baffins Pond Association.

Wiggle have kindly donated a £500 state-of-the-art bike as a prize. The lucky winner will be selected from entrants who manage to raise more than £50 sponsorship.

Portsmouth Cycle Exchange have also kindly donated two bikes that will be awarded to the 'best dressed rider' and the person who raises the most sponsorship money.

Portsmouth Cycle is helping with the event providing marshals and we will be having a stall at the start/finish.
