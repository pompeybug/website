# SOLENT TRANSPORT // A CITY TO SHARE

Our next public meeting will take place on Thursday 13th November at 7pm. The venue will be room 0.08 in Park Building, part of the University just [behind the Guildhall](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Park+Building/@50.7973982,-1.0946302,18z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x48745d9dc1adc937:0x22b935c9e0be59f9!8m2!3d50.7974791!4d-1.0942233!16s%2Fg%2F11b7f_hjqg?entry=ttu).

We are pleased to welcome Phil Marshall, Principal Transport Planner for Solent Transport (the successor organisation to Transport for South Hampshire). Phil will brief us on transport policy and funding in our area.

We'll then brief on the strategy we've developed for cycling in Portsmouth - entitled "A City to Share". This strategy was successfully launched to city leaders including Cllrs Donna Jones and Gerald Vernon-Jackson on the 3rd November. We'll give you a full brief on the strategy and the response so far.

Find out more about the strategy at it's own website [acitytoshare.org](http://acitytoshare.org) or join the debate on twitter using the hashtag [#acitytoshare](https://twitter.com/hashtag/acitytoshare).

It should be an exciting meeting and we hope to see you there.
