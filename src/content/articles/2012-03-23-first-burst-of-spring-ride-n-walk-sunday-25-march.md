Winter’s on the way out, so why not go out? Join our **First Burst of Spring Ride ‘n’ Walk** on Sunday 25 March.

Meet in the Good Companions car park at 10am (bottom of the Eastern Road).

We’ll head up the cycleway to Farlington Marshes and walk around the shoreline to see the early signs of Spring. All welcome!

We aim to be back by 1pm.
