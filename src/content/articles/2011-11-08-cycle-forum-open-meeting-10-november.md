At the Cycle Forum's Open Meeting on 10 November we will be reporting on the CTC/Cyclenation conference which was held in Sheffield in October and where the theme was Cycle Campaigning and Localism - Threats and Opportunities.

Other topics include: Portsmouth City Council's transport plans for 2012/13; our Winter Bike Ride Programme and the Department for Transport's new traffic signs.

The event will be in Meeting Room 1 at Portsmouth Guildhall from 7-9pm.  All welcome!
