This month we will be having a report from the Velo-City conference held in Seville in March.

We'll also have an update on the Local Sustainable Transport Fund bids by Portsmouth City Council and Transport for South Hampshire. The LSTF is a Government sponsored programme to reduce carbon emissions and boost economic activity in cities and towns.

Finally, we want to hear from you about your priorities for the Forum. What do you want us to do?

The meeting starts runs from 7-9pm in meeting room 1 at Portsmouth Guildhall.
