The final [Bike Week information leaflet](/public/assets/docs/bike-week-leaflet-final-version2.pdf) is out now and available to download. We are running some of the rides as are Friends of the Earth and The Community Cycle Centre is offering to check bikes over and help repair them on the first Saturday of Bike week on the 16th. Have a look at the full programme and come along and enjoy some of the rides. There's a Treasure Hunt ride and one that looks at the work of Thomas Ellis Owen in Gosport. We're looking forward to our annual Fish and Chip ride on Friday and the Two Little Ducks, NCN 22 ride on the last Sunday.

The rings ride looks interesting and you can use the map to collect your own rings too!
