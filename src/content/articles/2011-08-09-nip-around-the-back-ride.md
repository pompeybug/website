Join us on Wednesday evening for a 'nip around the back'.  A lovely evening ride with spectacular views over the city and countryside behind.

The ride takes us up and over the hill and along country lanes to Purbrook and up the back of the hill again to The George, then home.

We did this ride earlier in the year,; and its so good we're doing it again.

The weather looks set to be fine so the views will be even better from the top.

We start at 6pm in the Guildhall Square and aim to finish by 8.30.
