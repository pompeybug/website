July's meeting of Portsmouth Cycle Forum will be at the home of the largest on-line supplier of cycle goods, Wiggle at North Harbour. Wiggle have kindly allowed us to use their conference room for our bi-monthly get-together.  Starting at 7pm, we'll be getting updates on local cycling issues and having a look around Wiggle's cycle workshops.

## Getting there:

For those travelling from the city, there will be a "bike bus" leaving the Guildhall Square at 6.15pm with pick-up points along the route at the Mountbatten Centre (6.30pm), Hilsea Lido (by the splashpool 6.40pm).  Wiggle's offices are at 4 Harbourgate on Southampton Road, PO6 4BQ (north side, between the Paulsgrove junction and Compass Road) and the meeting starts at 7pm.  All welcome.
