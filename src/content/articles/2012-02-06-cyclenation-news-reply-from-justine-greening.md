![Cyclenation Logo](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/wp-cyclenation-news/cnlogo.jpg)<p>Andre has had a reply declining his invitation to meet and talk about cycling with Justine Greening

It says the governement is committed to supporting sustainable travelincluding walking and cycling blah, blah, blah and seems to suggest that all cycling issues will be sorted through the LSTF!

Wow, what will we do when its all been sorted in the next 4 years?

Nevermind we can still have our say through the National Cycling Forum, although the experience of government or local government cycling fora is often that they are talking shops to keep the real campaigning quiet!
