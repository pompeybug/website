[![Fish n chip Cycle Ride](/assets/fish-and-chip-shop-sign-150x150.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/06/bike-week-2011-fishy-friday-bike-ride/fish-and-chip-shop-sign/)This Sunday we'll be getting the ferry for another of our popular fish and chip rides, you don’t even have to eat fish to enjoy it, several regular attendees don’t! This time we are going Gosport_wards_ to enjoy our feast at Lee overlooking the Solent. The ride begins at the Hard at 11 on Sunday 25th September and the ferry costs around £4.

Once you've ridden to Lee you'll have earned your chips.
