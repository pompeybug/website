Bikeradar reports that some 21 [Waitrose stores across the country are introducing free bike trailers](http://www.bikeradar.com/beginners/news/article/waitrose-launches-free-bike-trailers-19847) to help shoppers get their goods home by bicycle.

Equipped with large canvas shopping bags, the trailers will be loaned out for a day free of charge to any Waitrose customers who wish to use them.

The supermarket hopes the scheme will encourage its customers to cycle to its stores rather than travelling by car.

The nearest participating branches are in Gosport and Chichester.

We hope the scheme is successful and urge Waitrose to bring the facility to the Southsea store as soon as possible.
