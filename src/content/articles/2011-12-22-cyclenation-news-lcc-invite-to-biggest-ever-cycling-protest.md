An invitation to the 'biggest ever cycling protest' 

> The London Cycling Campaign is seeking a commitment from the candidates to "make London a more liveable city by making our streets as safe an inviting for cycling as they are in Holland."

> Details to be announced in January 2012 following conclusion of discussions with authorities.

> In the meantime, please start spreading the word that there will be a big event in central London on Sat 28 April 2012 to demonstrate for better cycling facilities and which your members may be interested in supporting. It would be nice to see a few other campaign groups organise trips down. Don't forget, you could also make the most of the weekend by coming into London on Friday evening to join Critical Mass.
