Fingers are crossed for a dry and sunny Sunday 29 July when we'll be setting-off at 10am from The Hard Interchange (by the Gosport Ferry) to cross the harbour and then cycling along the coast to the beautiful Titchfield Haven. We'll have a refreshment stop and there'll be time to explore the nature reserve or beach (or both) before returning. The pace will be leisurely- all ages and abilities welcome.
