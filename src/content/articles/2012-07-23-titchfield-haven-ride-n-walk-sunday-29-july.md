[![Titchfield Haven](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Titchfield-Haven2-300x198.jpg "Titchfield Haven")](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Titchfield-Haven2.jpg)Fingers are crossed for a dry and sunny Sunday 29 July when we'll be setting-off at 10am from The Hard Interchange (by the Gosport Ferry) to cross the harbour and then cycling along the coast to the beautiful Titchfield Haven. We'll have a refreshment stop and there'll be time to explore the nature reserve or beach (or both) before returning. The pace will be leisurely- all ages and abilities welcome.
