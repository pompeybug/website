Portsmouth Cycle Forum presented a deputation at the PCC Traffic &amp; Transportation meeting on the 15th July.  The deputation was against the proposed implementation of echelon-style parking outside the old cinema in Cosham.  Our argument was that echelon parking presents an unacceptable hazard to all vulnerable road users, especially cyclists.

The outcome was that the decision to implement the echelon parking was deferred until a meeting has taken place between the retail manager for Cosham, the PCC officers responsible and the cycle forum.Â  The text of our deputation is attached, along with the traffic regulation order (TRO) which proposed the echelon parking.
