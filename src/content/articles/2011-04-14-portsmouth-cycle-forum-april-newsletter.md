The [April Newsletter](/public/assets/docs/PCF-Newsletter-April-2011.pdf) is now available with the latest news and views on cycling in Portsmouth.

This month we look at so-called Dangerous Cycling, we report on the Polite Cycling initiative and we bring you up-to-date on Portsmouth City Council's latest transport initiatives.
