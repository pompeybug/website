Our open meeting on 12 July was at Wiggle in Southampton Road where we learned about the history of the company from its roots at Butler’s Cycles in Southsea to its current position as one of the UKs leading on-line cycle retailers.

We were able to see the extensive workshop facilities where bikes are built and assembled for customers around the world. We’d like to thank Wiggle very much for their hospitality.
