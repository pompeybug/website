John Holland Memorial Day: Saturday 29th June 2019

Anyone who knew John knows that he was involved with numerous projects in and around Portsmouth. To celebrate his life, his contributions to the people of our city, and to express how fond of John his many friends were, a group of them have come together to organise a day of remembrance in his honour on the afternoon and evening of 29th June 2019.
