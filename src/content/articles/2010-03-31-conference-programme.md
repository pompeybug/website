The programme for the forthcoming CTC/Cyclenation conference is taking shape and it's looking good.  The cycle forum is hosting the conference at Portland Building (part of the University of Portsmouth) on the 17th April. Â We now have a full programme of confirmed speakers on subjects from 20mph to law enforcement.
