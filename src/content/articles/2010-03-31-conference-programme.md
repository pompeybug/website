The programme for the forthcoming CTC/Cyclenation conference is taking shape and it's looking good.  The cycle forum is hosting the conference at Portland Building (part of the University of Portsmouth) on the 17th April.  We now have a full programme of confirmed speakers on subjects from 20mph to law enforcement.  Full details are [here on the conference website](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/conference/programme/) - check them out and book your place.
