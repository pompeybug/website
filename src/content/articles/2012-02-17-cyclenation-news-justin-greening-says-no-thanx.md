This is a transcript of (State for Transport) Justine Greening's Reply to (Chair of Cyclenation) Andre Curtis' offer to meet and discuss "cycling issues":

> Dear Andre,

> Thank you for your letter of Wednesday 19 October 2011 suggesting a meeting to discuss cycling issues.

> The Government is committed to support sustainable travel, including walking and cycling, as set out in the Coalition agreement. We have made available &pound;560m over the next 4 years for projects under the local sustainable transport fund and have committed to support Bikeability cycle training for the remainder of this parliament.

> As you know, we have also created a national Cycling Forum, chaired by Norman Baker MP. Thank you for your involvement in this forum, and I hope you will continue to contribute in the future. I believe the group will play and important role in bringing all interested parties together to discuss real action towards our shared goal of promoting cycling as a safe, healthy and green travel choice.

> I assure you I will keep touch with Norman Baker on relevant issues from this group and I wish you luck on your on-going work.

> Best wishes

> Justine Greening

So that'll be a *'No thanks'* then?
