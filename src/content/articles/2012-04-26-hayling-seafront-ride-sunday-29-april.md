Our April bike ride takes us to Hayling Island where we'll ride along the seafront at Hayling as far as Eaststoke and back with time to explore the attractions.

We aim to be back by 1pm.  Meet at the Ferry pontoon, Eastney at 09.45 in time for the 10.am ferry.  Dont forget to bring some change for the ferry.
