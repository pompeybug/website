The Community Cycle Centre's next "Adopt a Bike Day" is on Saturday 21 May from 10 to 12 at the Stacey Centre, Walsall Road, Copnor, PO3 6DN.

We have a selection of refurbished child, youth and adult bicycles which we will give away in exchange for a donation to cover our costs.

If you have an old bike languishing in your garden shed that you’d like to donate to our not-for-profit project then we’d be pleased to hear from you.
