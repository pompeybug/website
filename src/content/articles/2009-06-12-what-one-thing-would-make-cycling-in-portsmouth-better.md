This was the question asked of over 100 cyclists who visited Portsmouth Cycle Forum’s stands at the D-Day charity Bike Rides, and the British Heart Foundation Round the Harbours charity ride. (6/7 June 2009).

Over 1400 cyclists from 8 months to 80 years old, on mountain bikes, racers, tourers, tandems and trailers spun their way round Portsmouth’s coastline in the two-day sunny celebration of cycling.

Portsmouth Cycle Forum’s team displayed their giant cycling map.  Visitors to the PCF stands discussed and plotted on the map the most dangerous places to ride a bike in Portsmouth. Over 100 riders joined the PCF e-mail network in support of PCF’s aim to advocate more, safer cycling in Portsmouth.
