I took a walk along Albert Road earlier today - buying gift-wrap for my Mum's birthday as it happens.  As always, Albert Road was choked by illegally parked vehicles.  It always is and I am always shocked by it, but today I decided it was time to start making some noise about it.  In the short walk from the Haslemere Road junction to the King's Theatre area I spotted at least 15 different offending vehicles. It is obvious from the quantity of offending vehicles that motorists consider the chance of being caught and fined to be minute.

I am hoping that if I (and hopefully some other people) start complaining about this then some Community Safety Officers will be tasked to deal with this.  So - next time you walk down Albert Road grab some pics and send them [PCC's parking office](http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/living/parking.html "PCC Parking Office"), and to your local Councillor.  That's what I've just done.

<td>Outside Sainsbury's near the junction with St Ronan's Road.  Always a trouble spot these days.  Three cars are parked on the double yellow lines despite the plentiful availability of legitimate spaces opposite.  In mitigation the red car does have a disabled badge, neither of the others do though.</td>

<td>I appreciate loading and unloading is permitted on double yellow lines, but surely there is a better way than this?  Parking vans and lorries half on the pavement on a busy street in the middle of the day just seems wrong.</td>
