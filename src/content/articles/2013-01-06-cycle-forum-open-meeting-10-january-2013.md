The first meeting of Portsmouth Cycle Forum in 2013 will be on Thursday 10 January at the Stacey Centre, Walsall Road, Copnor at 7pm.  This month we will be welcoming speakers from Portsmouth City Council who will be telling us about the Northern Road bridge replacement project which will see extensive road closures and diversions in the coming months. In addition, they will be able to explain the proposals for a temporary one-way traffic system in and around Cosham High Street. We'll also have time for discussion and updates on our activities and cycling in general.

## How to find the Stacey Centre:

From the roundabout at the junction of Baffins Road, St Mary's Road and Milton Road, follow Langstone Road taking the second turning on the left into Lichfield Road followed by the first turning to the right into Walsall Road.  The centre is on the left hand side. The postcode is PO3 6DN.
