On the Bank holiday Monday Portsmouth Cycle Forum members Chris, Jayne, John, Pam and Roger went along to the popular May Fayre at St Mary’s Church in Fratton. It was wet all morning but we kept warm and dry at our stand inside! We spoke to loads of people – some committed cyclists, others lapsed; as well as non-cyclists.

It was a great opportunity to give information to experienced cyclists as well as encouragement to others, explain more about what we do as a Forum and talk about the Community Cycle Centre at Stacey Centre.

Our next event is at the Summer Fair in Victoria Park on 19 May. Come along – all support welcome!
