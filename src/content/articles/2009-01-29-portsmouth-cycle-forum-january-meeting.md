Report on the Portsmouth Cycle Forum Open Meeting - 29 January 2009

Despite the cold and windy weather there was a good attendance at the January 2009 meeting of the Portsmouth Cycle Forum.

Roger Inkpen presented the draft constitution for the Forum which will be fine-tuned and presented to the March meeting to be formally adopted.

We need to be properly constituted in order to be considered for grant funding from the various bodies.
