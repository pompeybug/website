The Times have [an online map](http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/public/cyclesafety/contact/) where you can plot all the bad spots for cycling in your area.

They are working with [Cyclestreets](http://www.cyclestreets.net/) and are planning to come up with an analysis of all the places pinpointed and are offering to share this info with local groups.

They are also using it to approach local authorities to see is they are prepared to sign up to the cyclesafe campaign.

So go online and map your horrors!
