We are very pleased to be able to write that the Hayling Ferry service is no longer under threat - PCF has been notified by Cllr Jason Fazackarley that PCC will not be cutting the subsidy.

Cllr Fazackarley said:
> "[The ferry] is saved, I have removed this [the proposed cut] as an offered saving by officers so Portsmouth contribution towards the ferry operation will remain unchanged. I cannot speak for any changes that the County Council may decide to make but Portsmouth City Council will NOT be making any cut to the subsidy."

Great news.
