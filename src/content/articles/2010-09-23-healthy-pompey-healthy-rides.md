Healthy Pompey have launched Healthy Rides – a chance to ride your bike further, without taking on the Tour de France!

The rides will be on different days and be of varying lengths and difficulties; something for everyone. Although you will be shown  the best cycle routes, these are purely social and leisure rides – they’ll keep to the slowest in the group and keep everyone together, giving you a chance to chat.
