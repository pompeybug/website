Do you want to explore the best route? Do you want to make new cycling friends? Do you want to find out how to keep your wheels turning?

Join us with your bike to <span style="color: #333300;">**<span style="color: #008000;">Cycle Friday</span>**</span>, at Cosham Station on June 25th at 7.30am where bike buddies from Portsmouth Cycle Forum will lead you to the City Centre and Gunwharf Quays.

Cyclists can join or leave **<span style="color: #008000;">Cycle Friday</span> **anywhere along the route which will pass the Mountbatten Centre and Continental Ferry Port using cycle routes throughout. The pace will be tailored to suit.

Whether you're new to cycling, returning to your bike after a break, or cycle every day, celebrate midsummer with an early morning cycle ride to work. PCF bike buddies will also offer a return ride by the same route in the evening leaving Gunwharf Quays at 4.30pm, back to Cosham at 5.45pm.

John Holland Cycle Forum Chairman said “This is a great opportunity to try out commuting by bicycle.  Cycle Friday is a regular event in other cities and we thought we’d try it out for Bike Week in Portsmouth“.
