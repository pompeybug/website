Our next public meeting will take place on Thursday 11th September at 7pm. The venue is [Southsea Coffee Co](http://www.southseacoffee.co.uk "Southsea Coffee Co") at 63 Osborne Rd in Southsea ([map](https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Southsea+Coffee+Co/@50.7850641,-1.0875733,17z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xb819951aede6fc65 "Southsea Coffee Co Location")).

We'll be hearing about [Wheels 4 All](http://www.cycling.org.uk/wfa/intro "Wheels 4 All"), a nationally recognised programme that embraces all children and adults with disabilities and differing needs, to engage in a quality cycling activity. By using specially adapted cycles, the activities are both physically and mentally stimulating and above all fun for everyone involved.

We'll also be presenting our research on the junctions in Portsmouth that are most lethal to cyclists. This follows our exposure of the shocking cycle casualty statistics for Portsmouth and PCC's response to them at [our last meeting](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2014/07/open-meeting-report/ "Open Meeting Report").
