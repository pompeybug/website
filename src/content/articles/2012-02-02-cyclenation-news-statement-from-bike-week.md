National Bike Week, the UK's biggest mass participation cycling event, will be taking place between 16th and 24th June 2012.

Registration for Bike Week events opens at the end of February. Please visit [www.bikeweek.org.uk](http://www.bikeweek.org.uk/) for further information.

Bike Week began as a grass-roots organisation in 1923, and provides a national umbrella for locally organised events and activities up and down the UK. In 2011, almost half a million participants took part in almost two thousand events across the UK.

In recent years Bike Week has benefited from sponsorship from Nokia, and most recently, been a headline event in EDF Energy's Team Green Britain campaign. In 2012, the event is currently seeking a sponsor and other commercial partners, but the support from the cycle industry (via Bike Hub) and Transport for London has enabled Bike Week to carry on hosting this nationwide event.
