Join Portsmouth Cycle Forum for a leisurely  ride around Portsea Island on Sunday morning 31 July.  We'll be leaving the Guildhall Square at 10.30am and we'll follow the Round the Island route described in the Portsmouth City Council leaflet.

The route is on quiet roads, cycle tracks and some unmetalled paths through Hilsea Lines and we should be back by 1.30pm.  All welcome.
