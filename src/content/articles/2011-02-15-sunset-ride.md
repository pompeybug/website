This Wednesday 16th February we will be meeting near the Victoria Park play area at  5.15 to go on the Healthy Pompey Sunset Ride. The route takes us around the less well known Horsea Island cycle route on the western side of Portsmouth. From the route we will enjoy some great views of the sun setting over Portsmouth Harbour.

The ride will take us along a flat and mainly off road route and we aim to be back for 6.30. This is set to be a lovely leisurely ride along a mostly unknown section of the coast, with a view of the sunset from a slightly different perspective.
