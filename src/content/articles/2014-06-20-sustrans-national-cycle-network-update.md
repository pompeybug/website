If you live in the Portsmouth and Havant area you now have a choice of safe, well-marked cycle routes to Southsea and Hayling seafronts or up to the South Downs.  Roger Inkpen is a local ranger for Sustrans – the charity creating a national cycle network.  He says:

> “all of these routes follow cycle tracks, quiet city streets and country lanes, and are suitable for all types of riders – young, old, occasional or serious cyclist.  There are over 50 miles of routes marked out, all within a mile of where people live.

> "The routes are all marked with Sustrans signs, fixed to existing signposts and fence posts.  Just follow the national cycle network number to your destination!"
