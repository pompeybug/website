It starts at 7pm and everyone is welcome to come along, meet us and join in and have your say. We have asked Martin Lavers (Deputy Head of Service for Transport Operations) to attend and talk about road safety audits. We'll also be looking at the city traffic light review to see improvements could be made for cyclists and pedestrians.
