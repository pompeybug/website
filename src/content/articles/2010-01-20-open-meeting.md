The cycle forum met on the 14th January.  The minutes from that meeting are not yet available but in the meantime here are two of the presentations from the meeting.

* [Chairman's Presentation - Portsmouth Cycle Forum 14 Jan 10 (Powerpoint File)](/assets/pres/Portsmouth-Cycle-Forum-14Jan10.ppt)
* [Roger Inkpen - Seafront Cycle Route Phase II](/assets/pres/SCF-Phase-II-v2-redux.ppt)

Unfortunately Barry Rawlings of Portsmouth City Council was unable to attend so there was no presentation on traffic signals.  The other agenda item was the new web site  - this is it!
