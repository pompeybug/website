**Bike week**[![bike week logo](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/bike-week2.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/06/bike-week-18th-26th-june-2011/bike-week-4/)

We will be in Guildhall Square on bike to work day Tuesday 21<sup>st</sup> June where we will be happy to talk about cycling 11am. There will also be Dr Bike and a Cemex truck in the square so you can try seeing cyclists from a truck drivers perspective.

The rides during the week include those listed below and of course our own **Fishy Friday Ride** – back by popular demand. This time we are visiting a different chippy and taking a different route. It was really good fun last year although if we keep it up we may have to go outside the boundary of Portsmouth to find a chippy, probably not for about 20 years though.

We will meet in the Guildhall Square at 5.30 on Friday and head off north along the pilgrims way route.
