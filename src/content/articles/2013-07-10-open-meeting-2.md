The next PCF open meeting will take place at 7pm on Thursday 11th July at the Stacey Centre.  A late breaking addition to the agenda of the meeting is that Julian Clarke of Transport Planning Associates will be coming to brief on the proposed development of a new Tesco Store on Fratton Way and the options for rerouting the shared use pedestrian and cycle route (Milton Lane) that runs across the proposed site and past Fratton Park.

###  Agenda

1.  Fratton Way Tesco proposal
2.  Open Street Map
3.  Sustrans update
4.  Local infrastructure report
5.  AOB

Please do come along - this is a great opportunity to express the cyclists point of view of the plans for an important new development in the city.

We'd like to make the session on Open Street Map as interactive as possible - if you'd like to bring a laptop then you will be able to try out the site as we go along.  It is a powerful tool for creating and distributing free geographic data.  This should prove extremely useful for mapping cycle infrastructure that is rarely featured accurately on standard maps.

The Stacey Centre is [located on Walsall Road in Copnor](http://goo.gl/maps/CCRwh).
