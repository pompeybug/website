We have just finalised our programme of rides for the coming few months.  The rides are open to riders of all abilities, young or old, fast or slow.  Each of the rides is guided by an experienced, trained ride leader and will move at the pace of the slowest rider.  These rides are all about seeing the city and its surrounds in a different way and at a relaxed pace.  Why not give them a try?

The first ride  is the Bluebells Ride and Walk on Sunday 12 May. It starts at 10am at The Good Companion pub on Eastern Road. The ride uses cycle paths and country roads to travel up the hill and round the back through Purbrook to bluebell wood for a walk through ancient woodland.
