At the meeting of the Portsmouth Cycle on 9 September we’ll be looking at the pros and cons of narrow cycle lanes, our response to the Local Transport Plan 3 (LTP3) consultation plus updates on current topics. 

We welcome all cyclists to come along and make your views known.

The meeting starts at 7pm and will be held in Meeting Room 1 on the 3rd floor of Portsmouth Guildhall.
