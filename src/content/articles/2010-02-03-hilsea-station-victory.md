Portsmouth City Council's planning committee today approved plans for a shared pedestrian and cycle route linking Devon Road in Copnor to Hilsea station.

The plan will give cyclists and pedestrians a much needed safe route to the station.  John Holland deputised in support of the proposals by PCC at the planning meeting.

There were two deputations against the proposals on behalf of local residents, who raised concerns about commuters parking in residential streets and using the new route to get to Hilsea station.

Councillor Luke Stubbs spoke effectively in support of the plan which was approved by a narrow majority.
