Naomi House, the charity providing support to children and young adults with life-limiting conditions and their families from across the Central South, are organising a cycle ride on Sunday 3 March.

Entrants can choose to ride either 40km or 100km and there is an option to pay a higher registration fee (£30) and not raise sponsorship, or pay a lower registration fee and aim to raise some money.
