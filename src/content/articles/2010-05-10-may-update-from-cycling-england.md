The May update from Cycling England includes an [on-carriageway cycle parking project in Brighton and Hove](http://www.dft.gov.uk/cyclingengland/category/scheme-of-the-month/ "On carriageway parking in Brighton and Hove"). Could this work in Portsmouth?

Cycling England is offering a free LTP review service to Local Authorities. This could be of particularly useful in the planning stage where more detailed advice on potential programmes may be required. For more information follow the link from the [DfT cycling home page](http://www.dft.gov.uk/cyclingengland/ "DfT cycling home page").

Results from the first three years of England’s first six Cycling Towns are now available on the Cycling England web site ([key information](http://www.dft.gov.uk/cyclingengland/docs/lift-off-for-cycling_headline-results_2010_final.pdf "Cycling Towns - key information"), [progress so far](http://www.dft.gov.uk/cyclingengland/cycling-cities-towns/results/ "Cycling Towns - progress so far")) and there are updates from the [Cycle Journey Planner project ](http://www.dft.gov.uk/cyclingengland/encouraging-cycling/journey-planner/ "Cycle Journey Planner Project")including how Local Authorities can get involved.![Cycling Engand logo](/assets/Cycling-Engand-logo.jpg "Cycling Engand logo")
