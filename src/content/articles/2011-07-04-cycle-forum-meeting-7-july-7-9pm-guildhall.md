Cycling in Downtown New York?  You're Joking aren't you?  Well the city council there are making revolutionary changes to their car-choked streets to encourage people to take to their bikes.  We'll hear more about this at the Cycle Forum's meeting on Thursday 7 July along with other topics from the recent Building Cycling Cultures conference .

We'll also have updates on schemes affecting cycling locally plus news from the Community Cycling Centre.

The meeting takes place at Portsmouth Guildhall (meeting room 1) from 7 to 9pm.
