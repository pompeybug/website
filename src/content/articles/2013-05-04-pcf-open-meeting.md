The next meeting for PCF is on Thursday 9 May at St Lukes Church Hall, next to Charter Academy, starting at 7pm.

**RASPBERRY PI ON A BIKE**

On the agenda this time we have guest speakers Rich Boakes and Craig Snyder from the University of Portsmouth. They’ll be talking about their ‘Magic Bike’ which uses sonar and a Raspberry Pi computer to detect passing vehicles and how close they are passing.

**YOUR VISION FOR CYCLING**

Following on from Mayor Boris Johnson’s Vision for Cycling in London, we want you to tell us what should be the cycling vision for Portsmouth. So get your thinking caps on!

There’ll also be a roundup of events for Bike Week in June and an opportunity to have your say.

Note: access to the hall is from the car park entrance in Greetham Street - [map here](http://goo.gl/maps/hooUU "St Luke").
