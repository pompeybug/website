Portsmouth Cycle Forum attended the Portsmouth Green Fair in the Guildhall Square on Saturday 5 September.

We spoke to many people including councillors, prospective MPs and cyclists - one of whom was on his way from Birmingham to Bilbao - by bike of course!

The day ended with a Q and A session on Southsea Seafront cycling with PCAN's Alan Burgess posing questions to Gerals Vernon-Jackson, Leader of Portsmouth City Centre.
