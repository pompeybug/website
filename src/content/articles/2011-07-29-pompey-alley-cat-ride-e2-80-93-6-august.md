Southsea Cycle Club is holding its first public [Alley Cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alleycat_races) event on Saturday 6 August.

An Alley Cat is a time trial/scavenger hunt style ride popular in bicycle messenger and fixed gear circles. Participants cycle to several checkpoints using whichever route they think is best.

Riders of all abilities, styles and ages are encouraged to join in the fun.

There are prizes for the winner and runners up but anyone is welcome to do it at their own pace. The club is asking for a minimum donation of £2 which will be given to the RNLI.

The event takes place on the Saturday 6 August at 6pm starting at the Bridge Tavern in Old Portsmouth.
