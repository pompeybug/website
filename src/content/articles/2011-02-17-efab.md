This coming Sunday is the last of the current sessions at the Efab (Eastney Family Bike Club). Its a mystery ride starting from Bransbury Park Community Centre at 11\. Before we ride off into the sunset, we will be having some fun and games on the courts at the rear of the Community Centre.

Even if you haven't been before come along and meet us all and join in.

There will be some more sessions in the Spring and anyone who wants to come along is more than welcome. We hope the families that have taken part this time round will be back for more. Thanks to everyone for making these sessions so enjoyable and we're looking forward to seeing you all again soon. If you want to keep in touch we have set up a Facebook page and will be posting news of rides and fun days on there.

The Sunday after next on 27th February we are taking part in the Tower to Tower ride and would love the families from the Efab to come along as the start point is at the residential tower at the University Campus Milton. We will be taking a leisurely ride to the Spinnaker Tower at Gunwharf.
