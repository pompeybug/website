Are you interested in how we get around within our communities?  By foot, bike, scooter, bus, car, train or boat - transport matters!

Culture Matters (formerly the Cultural Consortium) invites you to [a free workshop](https://web.archive.org/web/20201031122727/https://sites.google.com/site/gettingaround2010/) to discuss the future of transport in our area.

Join the debate on Monday, 20 Sept from 6:00pm – 8:45pm at the Groundlings Theatre School, 42 Kent St. Portsea, PO1 3BS.
