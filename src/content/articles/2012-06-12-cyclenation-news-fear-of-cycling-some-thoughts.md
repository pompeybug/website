Dave Horten's [article about the fear of cycling](http://thinkingaboutcycling.wordpress.com/article-fear-of-cycling/) is worth a read, and worth sharing with those who support the view that wearing helmets should be compulsory.  It has a good reference list too with some good further reading and evidence.

It's also relevant for arguing, like Spokes, against insiting that people wear helmets to participate in ride events.

Give it a read and let us know what you think &hellip;
