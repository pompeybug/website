Come along to our open meeting on Thursday 10 May when we’ll be looking at The Times campaign and hearing about Cyclenation, the umbrella group for cycle campaign groups in the UK.

Please note the new venue. We’ll be at the St Luke’s Church Hall which is off Greetham Street in the City Centre (2 mins from Portsmouth & Southsea station), opposite the Navigators Centre

There is cycle parking at the venue plus you can bring your bike inside into the hall.

We look forward to seeing you!
