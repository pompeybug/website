Portsmouth City Council Road Safety &amp; Active Travel team, supported by Sustrans will be running an event to raise awareness of the current cyclist casualty trend at junctions where 78% of cycle collisions in Portsmouth occur.

There will be a large van and a heavy goods vehicle provided by TJ Waste &amp; Recycling with bikes mocked up in the blind spots. Cyclists and drivers will be invited to see both sides of the coin from sitting in the vehicles and on the bikes.

The key messages will be that drivers need to check their mirrors and over their nearside shoulder before turning in and cyclists need to be aware that vehicles turning into them at junctions is the most likely collision that can befall them.

There will also be a Bike Doctor at the event who will provide free bike repairs as well as free hi-vis bag covers and cycle lights for visitors. The police will be providing cycle locking advice, cost price D-locks and bike security coding.

The event takes place on 30th August from 10:00 to 16:00 in the Guildhall Square.
