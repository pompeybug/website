A free 6-week cycle course starts at Eastney Community Centre on Sunday 16 January at 11am. It is for 5-7 year olds with their families including grandparents.

The course is part of the first new pilot scheme to develop local cycling activities that promotes best practise cycle education and training. The aim is to get more people to choose to ride safely and confidently on their bikes in Portsmouth.

This meets many PCC and LSP / LEP economic, social, health and environmental policy targets. With vehicle fuel and insurance price hikes and other economic challenges, this is a most topical, practical anti-poverty initiative.

The course is ably run by Healthy Pompey and Road Safety teams supported by Portsmouth Cycle Forum, the new volunteer-led Eastney Family Bike Club ( eFAB), Eastney Community Centre and local schools.

The Christmas Bike Party at Eastney Community Centre on 29 December was attended by some 50 people across the generations. 20 new bikes were security stamped, bikes were blinged, checked over and advice was offered by Dr Bike. Foggy fun was had around the obstacle course and on a guided local mystery bike ride.
