Portsmouth Cycle Forum and the PCC Healthy Pompey Team are organising a fabulous Family Easter Treasure  Hunt on Sunday 24 April. The fun starts at 10am at the Canoe Lake children's play area where there will be treasure to seek.  There'll be a short cycle ride to Bransbury Park where there will be even more things to find!  The event will finish at midday.
