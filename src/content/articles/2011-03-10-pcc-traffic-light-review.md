[![PCC Traffic Light Review](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/450px-Modern_British_LED_Traffic_Light-225x300.jpg "PCC Traffic Light Review")](/assets/450px-Modern_British_LED_Traffic_Light.jpg)A while ago we posted that Portsmouth City Council is in the process of reviewing traffic lights in the city, and that they had already engagmed with taxi drivers in this review ([here is a link to the post](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/01/city-traffic-light-review/ "City Traffic Light Review")).  We wrote to Cllr Fazackarley (member for traffic &amp; Transportation) to offer our support, we then spoke to him informally to repeat the offer and then wrote again.  Sadly no engagment has been forthcoming.  We were also not invited to the 'public' tour of problem junctions - this was only attended by carefully selected members of the public and not advertised for wider participation.

We did, however, get a great response from PCF members detailing their concerns with junctions around the city.  We have written these up into a report that has now been delivered to the Councillor.  We will keep you all posted of developments.
