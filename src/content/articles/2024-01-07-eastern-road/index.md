The traffic light column and control equipment that have been situated in the middle of the upgraded shared path at the Airport Service Road Junction have now been moved following the near completion of the coastal works, giving more space and visibility for all users when the new path opens later in 2024.

**However**, two years _after_ the completion of this section, we are _still_ waiting for the upgraded path to be widened from here to the Harvester Junction further south. This would complete phase one of the project to improve the route along the eastern side of the island.
