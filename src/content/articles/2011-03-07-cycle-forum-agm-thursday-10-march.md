We will be holding our Annual General Meeting  on Thursday 10th March at 7.00 pm in Meeting Room 1, Guildhall. Elections will be held for the Chairman, Vice-Chair, Secretary, Treasurer and Membership Secretary plus 5 committee members.

We aim to make the Forum as accountable and democratic as possible, and invite members to put themselves forward for these posts. Executive meetings are generally held once a month to discuss relevant and topical issues related to the Forum and cycling in general. They need not be onerous or time-consuming jobs - only if you want them to be!

After the formal business we'll be hearing about the forum's new bicycle recycling project, the Government's sustainable transport fund and the recent Eastney Family Bike Club sessions for 5-7 year-olds (and their parents).

Just as importantly, annual membership subscriptions are due for renewal at the modest fee of £5\. This fee helps to pay running costs for the Forum including insurance for events and rides. The Treasurer will be taking subscriptions at the AGM and you can also join or renew through this Web site [here](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/join/).
