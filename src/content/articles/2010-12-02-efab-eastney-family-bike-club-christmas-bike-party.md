If you’ve got a new bike for Christmas or even if you want to cherish and love your old bike come along to the Community Centre in Bransbury Park on December 29<sup>th</sup> at 12 until 2.30 for a great launch party to celebrate the start of EFaB.

There’ll be bike-games and challenges for all ages, free Dr Bike checks, looking at routes, short rides and security marking. 

You can improve your cycle skills and have a good laugh at the same time. Everyone's welcome.

All you need to do is bring your bikes…
