In response to the lively public debate about the virtues of the new seafront cycle route we have produced [a set of frequently asked questions and answers](/infrastructure/seafront-cycle-route/) to address some of the most common concerns.

Portsmouth's Cycle Forum believes that the new cycle route makes a massively positive contribution to the seafront and the city and is in whole-hearted support of it.  If you haven't tried it yet then we can only suggest you get your bike out and go for a ride.
