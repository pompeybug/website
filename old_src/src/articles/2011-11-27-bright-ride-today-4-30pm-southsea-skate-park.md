For this lovely family ride we'll adorn our bikes in christamas lights and bright bits and go off along the seafront.

This was such good fun last year seeing how many lights and bright bits the children managed to get on themselves and their bikes!

We are meeting again this year outside Southsea Skate Park on Southsea Common, Sunday 27th November, 4.30 - 6pm.
