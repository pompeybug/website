[![quiz wheel](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/quiz-wheel1-150x150.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/12/cycle-quiz/quiz-wheel-2/)Tomorrow at 7.30 we will be at the [King Street tavern](http://www.thekingstreettavern.co.uk/ "KST") (70 King Street) for the cycle quiz. This is our second year and last year it was great so come along, even if the quiz is dodgy the half time tapas supplied by Sam will be lovely!
