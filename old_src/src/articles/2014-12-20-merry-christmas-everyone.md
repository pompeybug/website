A very merry Christmas to one and all from all of us at Portsmouth Cycle Forum. 2014 has been a very successful year for Portsmouth Cycle Forum and I'd like to thank you for the part you've played in that. We began the year with a visit from Bristol Cycle Campaign who told us about the cycling strategy they'd developed for their city, and we finished the year by doing the same. The launch of our cycling strategy '[A City to Share](http://acitytoshare.org "A City to Share")' was more successful than we dared hope and more than justified the huge effort put in to it by a dedicated team of volunteers.

In 2014 we were able to bring cycle safety to the forefront of political debate, making it front page news in the paper. This led to a 10 minute documentary piece on the BBC's 'Inside Out' current affairs programme.

We've really been delighted with the positive engagement we've had with Councillors and Officers this year. We're really looking forward to working hard with themÂ to build on the great work we've done this year to bring some really positive changes to the city's roads in 2015.

However, we are an entirely voluntary organisation funded solely by our members so none of this would have been possible without your support. The positive engagements from you and the constructive debates at our open meetings have been central to the progress we've made with the city council. Thanks to you all, have a great christmas and very best wishes for a happy and healthy 2015.
