10-10-10 is a world-wide day for global action on the environment (see [http://www.350.org/](http://www.350.org/) for more info).  [Chichester Cycle Campaign](http://chicycle.org.uk/) are staging an event to draw attention to the fact that cycling is a more environmentally friendly way to get from A to B.

They are holding an event at the Cross in Chichester at noon on that Sunday and are giving away 10 10-10 tags to the first 10 cyclists who turn up.  Participants can then either take part in a 10 mile ride or cycle 10 times round the city walls or just join in the photo and cycle home at their leisure.

ChiCycle will be handing out their 20's Plenty petitions and hope that people will be able to get 10 signatures each as part of their contribution to this global day.  [20's Plenty ](http://www.20splentyforus.org.uk/)is a campaign to make residential streets safer for all vulnerable road users especially children and old people, pedestrians and cyclists.
