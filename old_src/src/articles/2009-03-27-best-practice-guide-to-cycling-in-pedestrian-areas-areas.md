Portsmouth Cycle Forum has prepared a document detailing the technical aspects of permitting cycling on sections of Southsea promenade.

The intended audience is for the councillors who will make a decision of the proposed seafront cycle route but it will be of interest others in Portsmouth and elsewhere.

This should be read in conjunction with the Department for Transport's Traffic Advisory Leaflet giving guidance on cycling in pedestrian areas.
