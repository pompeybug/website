Local transport plans are an important part of transport planning in England. Strategic transport authorities (in our case Portsmouth City Council) are expected to prepare them as forward-looking plans and present them to the Department for Transport (DfT).

The current Local Transport Plan (LTP2) is due to end in 2011 and LTP3 is in preparation.  LTP3 is potentially a very long lived plan (possibly in excess of 15 years) and it is therefore essential that we get cycling into the heart of the plan from the outset.  With this in mind PCF members and CTC Right-to-Ride reps Hilary Reed and Jon Spencer met with the PCC LTP3 team today. As a result PCC has committed to engage with the cycle forum throughout the creation of LTP3.
