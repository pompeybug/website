**Our 2021 Annual General Meeting will take place at 7.00pm on Thursday 22nd April.**

It is an opportunity to come and hear about what we are doing and voice your thoughts about what we should aim for in the next 12 months.

Given the current restrictions for gathering in person, this will be a virtual meeting hosted via Zoom. Members have until noon on the day of the meeting to register for the event. Connection details to attend the meeting via zoom will be sent to those who have signed up after the deadline for registrations. [**You can register via eventbrite here**](https://pcfagm21.eventbrite.co.uk)

Non-members are welcome to join the meeting but must register no later than 24 hours before its start time. You are welcome to listen to the debate but cannot vote at the meeting. If you wish to become a member you can do so [**FOR FREE via this link**](https://www.pompeybug.co.uk/join/)

As required by the constitution, nominations are now open for our officer roles of Chair, Secretary, Treasurer and Vice Chair. These four main officer roles are subject to an election process if there is more than one person standing for the same position. You must be a member of the PCF to be able to stand for any of them. The winner will be decided by a straight majority of members in attendance at the AGM.

2020 saw quite a lot of demand on the committee's time as various issues required fast detailed feedback or response.  We are also looking to expand the pool of people on the committee to help share the workload and spread the knowledge of issues around the city, as well as looking to establish a network of local area 'champions' across the city.

**Chair**

The main contact point of the forum, who has a clear sense of what is needed and where resources should be utilised.  There will be some interaction with both written and broadcast media as well as an expectation to act as a liaison with council officers and politicians when necessary. A good knowledge of the issues around cycling and experience of campaigning would also be a benefit.

**Secretary**

A predominantly administrative role that involves ensuring that minutes are taken in committee meetings and some general organisation of committee business such as confirming meeting details and locations.

**Treasurer**

As the title would suggest, the holder of the purse strings and the person who keeps an eye on the levels of finance required to carry out the actions from committee.  Would also need to act as signatory for the bank account.

**Vice-Chair**

To deputise for the Chair when necessary but also has scope to take on specific projects as required to help progress the work of the Forum.

**Committee members**

If you wish to become more involved with our work but are not sure what is involved then joining the committee is a good way to discover the scope of the campaign and perhaps then specialise in an area of interest.  We would particularly welcome members who have experience of setting up events or group rides, press & media experience or an interest in the planning system.

**Local Area Champions**

To act as a contact point for two-way information flow of information for specific areas of the city, acting as a lower level of regular engagement without committee responsibilities. Would particularly suit those cycling on a day to day basis who travel regularly around their area and are able to identify issues that act as a barrier to increasing the numbers of people cycling.

You can put yourself forward for any of these roles [via our nominations survey](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/VT985DZ) if you are interested in any of the above. We are asking for you to provide personal details so that we can follow up with those applying.
