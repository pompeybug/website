![Cyclenation Logo](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/wp-cyclenation-news/cnlogo.jpg)<p>An invite to the 'biggest ever cycling protest' from Mustafa Arif of LCC 

 Save the date: 28 April 2012, central London - biggest every cycling protest 

The London Cycling Campaign is seeking a commitment from the 
 candidates to "make London a more liveable city by making our streets as 
 safe an inviting for cycling as they are in Holland."

Details to be announced in January 2012 following conclusion of discussions 
 with authorities.

In the meantime, please start spreading the word that there will be a big 
 event in central London on Sat 28 April 2012 to demonstrate for better 
 cycling facilities and which your members may be interested in supporting. 
 It would be nice to see a few other campaign groups organise trips down. 
 Don't forget, you could also make the most of the weekend by coming into 
 London on Friday evening to join Critical Mass.
