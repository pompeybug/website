National Bike Week, the UK&rsquo;s biggest mass participation cycling event, will be taking place between 16 &ndash; 24 June 2012.

Registration for Bike Week events opens at the end of February. Please visit [www.bikeweek.org.uk](http://www.bikeweek.org.uk/) for further information.

Bike Week began as a grass-roots organisation in 1923, and provides a national umbrella for locally organised events and activities up and down the UK. In 2011, almost half a million participants took part in almost 2,000 events across the UK.

In recent years Bike Week has benefited from sponsorship from Nokia, and most recently, been a headline event in EDF Energy&rsquo;s Team Green Britain campaign. In 2012, the event is currently seeking a sponsor and other commercial partners, but the support from the cycle industry (via Bike Hub) and Transport for London has enabled Bike Week to carry on hosting this nationwide event.
