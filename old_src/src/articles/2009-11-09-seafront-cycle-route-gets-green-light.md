Portsmouth City Council approved the first phase of the Southsea Seafront cycle route at the Cabinet Meeting on 9 November.

The route will be on the road between Eastney Swimming Pool and South Parade Pier, next to the promenade. The dangerous echelon (angled) parking bays will be replaced with spaces parallel to the road.

Portsmouth Cycle Forum welcomes this decision and we look forward to the opening of the route in the spring of 2010.

We spoke in support of the proposals at the meeting along with the CTC and the Portsmouth Disability Forum.

Southsea Seafront Traders were concerned that the loss of 150 parking spaces would impact their businesses, however the figures presented showed that these spaces were full on very few occasions during the year. At the busiest times, overflow parking will be available on Southsea Common and councillors agreed to look at other sites to replace the spaces that will be lost.

The permanent Park and Ride system will provide much needed relief to the parking problems in Portsmouth and Southsea when it comes on-stream.

The route for Phase 2, from South Parade Pier to Clarence Pier, has yet to be decided.

We will be working with Portsmouth City Council and other interested parties to ensure that it will be safe and practicable.
