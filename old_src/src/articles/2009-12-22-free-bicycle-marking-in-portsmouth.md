Hampshire Police are offering free 'Cycle Marking' sessions in Commercial Road, Portsmouth between 10am and 4pm on 19th January, 17th February and 17th March.

There have been 1361 cycles stolen in the city between January and October (that's 35 per week!) and one of the biggest challenges facing the police is the fact that they are unable to identify the rightful owners once a bike is found.

Marking your beloved will much increase the chance of getting it back from the PoliceÂ  if it does disappear.
