![Cyclenation Logo](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/wp-cyclenation-news/cnlogo.jpg)<p>Bike week 2012 is on its way and people are [registering their events](http://www.bikeweek.org.uk/page.php?id=3 "Bike week events registration") for this year.

The theme of the big bike fix worked so well last year that we are all encouraged to fix bikes again this year.

So lets hear about any events you are holding, it can be as simple as a bike checking session or a ride.....
