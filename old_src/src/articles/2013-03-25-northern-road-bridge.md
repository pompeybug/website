If you’ve been hibernating over winter (and why not!) you might have missed the work on Northern Road Bridge in Cosham. Nobody is questioning the need to replace an ageing bridge over the railway line, but it is vital cyclists’ needs are considered when road works are being planned.

When we found out the road over the bridge would be open for buses, taxis and minicabs, with cyclists having to get off and walk with pedestrians, we queried this with Portsmouth City Council. The project team have been very willing to discuss our suggestions, including monitoring traffic flow to see if cycling could be allowed. They’ve also said they will consult with us on the best layout for the permanent cycle lane markings.

We’ve also discussed allowing two-way cycling in Cosham High Street, which has been turned into a one-way system. This is ‘temporary’ but we need to make sure that if it does become permanent then cyclists needs are catered for, avoiding making life difficult for those wanting to travel the ‘wrong’ way. Portsmouth City Council have committed to meet with PCF and discuss the future of the temporary one way system before the bridge works are completed.   We’ll keep you up-to-date with any news.
