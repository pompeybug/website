This month we'll be looking back to the conference and asking the question : Portsmouth - A Future Cycling City?

Jon Spencer will repeat his much-acclaimed talk which, if you've not seen, will make you laugh and think!

We'll be asking YOU what you want us to look at over the next 12 months.

Also a new government will have different priorities and we want to make sure that cycling is one of them.

And finally, there's that new cycle path which has created ripples in Eastney and Craneswater. What's your view? How would you like to see the phase 2 section built?

Venue: Meeting Room 1, 3rd Floor, Guildhall.
Starts at 19:00, duration is 02:00 hours.
