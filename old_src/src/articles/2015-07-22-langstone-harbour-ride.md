We take the clockwise route around Langstone Harbour past Farlington Marshes and down the Billy Trail, then catch the ferry home.  Flat, quiet roads/cycle paths – some off-road track.  Meet 10am at Bransbury Park car park.  Note: single ferry fare with  bike is £3.70.  Starts at 10:00, duration is 04:00 hours.
