Tomorrow we're off to explore the Sustrans route 22 along the western side of Portsmouth.

The local ranger has been working hard to sign this part of the national cycle network so come along and see where we fit into the national picture.

Hope to see you at the Hard (near the station) at 10.30 tomorrow morning.
