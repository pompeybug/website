Our next meeting is on Thursday 14 March at Eastney Community Centre in Bransbury Park, starting at 7.15pm. The first three quarters of an hour will be given over to our Annual General Meeting where we will elect the officers and committee for 2013/14.

We aim to make the Forum as accountable and democratic as possible, and invite members to consider joining the committee. Executive meetings are generally held once a month to discuss relevant and topical issues related to the Forum and cycling in general.

After the AGM we'll be catching-up on events local and national including the Local Sustainable Transport Plan (LSTF).

Just as importantly, annual membership subscriptions are due for renewal at the modest fee of £5\. This fee helps to pay running costs for the Forum including insurance for events and rides. The Treasurer will be taking subscriptions on the night. Cheques should be made out to Portsmouth Cycle Forum. Alternatively payment can be made [on-line](/join/ "Join Portsmouth Cycle Forum") or cheques can be posted to: Joe McGannan, 27 Thurbern Road, Portsmouth, PO2 0PH.
