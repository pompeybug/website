*   **Local Election Roundup**: We have written to candidates and parties in the forthcoming Local Election to ask them to support our manifesto for cycling. How did they respond?
*   **Cycle Safety in Portsmouth**: Did you know that more cyclists are killed or injured in Portsmouth than anywhere else in England outside of London?  Think that should change?  Come along and help make it happen.
*   **The Regeneration of the Hard**: We will present the plans to regenerate The Hard.
If you’d like to see better facilities for cyclists in Portsmouth and more people cycling then please come along. All are welcome.
