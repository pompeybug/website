We previously advertised a Ride &amp; Dig at Hilsea Station cycle path, the purpose being to help Portsmouth Tree Wardens to plant a fruiting hedge. Thanks to the large number of volunteers who turnrd out to help on Friday, most of the planting has been done, so the "dig" element of Sunday's ride has been cancelled.

Should anyone wish to go for a cycle ride on Sunday then we'll still meet at 10am in the Guildhall Square and travel to Hilsea to see the good work (and it does look good). From there we could ride via the A27 cycle route on to Havant for coffee.
