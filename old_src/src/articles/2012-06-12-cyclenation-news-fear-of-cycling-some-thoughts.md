![Cyclenation Logo](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/wp-cyclenation-news/cnlogo.jpg)<p>[Dave Horten's article](http://thinkingaboutcycling.wordpress.com/article-fear-of-cycling/ "fear of cycling") about the fear of cycling is worth a read and sharing with those who support the view that wearing helmets should be compulsory. It has a good reference list too with some good further reading and evidence.

Its also relevant for arguing, like Spokes, against insiting that people wear them to participate in ride events.

Give it a read and let us know what you think.......
