[Dublin Cycling Campaign](http://www.dublincycling.ie/SaveCyclingOfficer "dublin cycling campaign")&nbsp;[](http://www.dublincycling.ie/)


Thanks to all who have helped so much with this campaign! &nbsp;Heartening  that the City Council and Minister for the Environment, Community and  Local Government got together and extended the Cycling Officer's  contract for six months. &nbsp;We really hope that this gives time to find  permanent funding for the Officer's salary, given the extraordinarily  high ratio of benefit to cost that the promotion of cycling achieves.  &nbsp;Though it's the principle of having the Officer job in place, as set  out by the National Cycle Policy Framework, we have to say that the  current Officer, Dr. Ciaran Fallon, has been a really effective and  capable voice for cycling in Dublin for the last 3 years, and we do hope  he'll see fit to continue in the job!
