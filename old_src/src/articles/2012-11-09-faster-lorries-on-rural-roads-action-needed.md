![Say no to faster lorries](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/2206492974_ed2e28cb90-300x225.jpg "Say no to faster lorries")The DfT has opened a consultation on increasing the speed limit for HGV's on single carriageway roads. This seems to be because many lorries ignore the current limit of 40mph anyway. This apparently gives the firms that do ignore the limit a competitive advantage as they are able to deliver goods more quickly.

If you don't like the idea of being flattened by high speed hauliers on narrow roads, and perhaps would like to see the current limit better enforced, then please take the time to respond to the consultation. Â This can be done online and is linked below.
