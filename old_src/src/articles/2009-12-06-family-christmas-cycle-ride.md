Eleven hardy cyclists (including two under-fives) braved the stormy conditions for the Cycle Forum's first ever Christmas cycle ride on Sunday 6 December.

The rain was falling at 9am, but an hour later the clouds dispersed and the sun shone allownig us to take the scenic, and largely off-road, route.

Following the City Council's guide 'Circular Ride Around Langstone Harbour', we travelled from Eastney in a clockwise direction taking in the delights of the Eastern Road cycleway, the Farlington to Broadmarsh cycle route (alongside the A27), then the Hayling Billy route along the old railway line.

With only one cycle casualty (a puncture), we arrived at the Ferry Boat Inn on Hayling Island and pursuaded the ferryman to make a special journey back to Portsmouth.

The distance travelled was approximately 15 miles / 21 km.
