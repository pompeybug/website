We'll also be welcoming members of the Somerstown regeneration project team to talk about about The Hub, a new community building which will span Winston Churchill Avenue, and how the pedestrian and cycle routes will be catered for in the plans.

And finally, we also have an open forum for everyone to share news, thoughts and ideas for the new year.

The event will be in Meeting Room 1 at Portsmouth Guildhall from 7-9pm. All welcome.
