We have a selection of refurbished child, youth and adult bicycles which we will give away in exchange for a donation to cover our costs.

If you have a old bike languishing in your garden shed that you’d like to donate to our not-for-profit project then we’d be pleased to hear from you. Call us on 07407 374 497 or email community@pompeybug.org.uk.

The Community Cycle Centre is managed by Portsmouth Cycle Forum.
