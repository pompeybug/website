# How to hire a cargo bike in Portsmouth

In 2021 following a successful Crowdfunder initiated by Southsea Cycles, Sustrans and Portsmouth Climate Action Board, a Community Cargo Project was born. The project aims to make electric cargo bikes available to hire at a low cost so that more people can access the benefits of cargo biking. The funds raised allowed the purchase of two electric cargo bikes. A Babboe Curve trike is now available to try out while second one – a Babboe City Mountain two-wheeler is coming soon.

## What you can hire:

- Electric Babboe Curve – three-wheeler box bike perfect to transport large weekly shopping or up to 4 children. Benches are equipped with four three-point harnesses. A rain cover can be requested for riding in wet weather. Front box loading capacity is 100 kg.

- Coming soon - Electric Babboe City Mountain – two-wheeler cargo bike which can accommodate up to two children or your weekly grocery shop. Front box loading capacity is 80 kg. 

- Accessories such as helmets and locks are also available to hire in the shop, just ask.
