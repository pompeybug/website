In the early 1990s the A3 road north from the A3(M) was replaced by a dual carriageway that, for the vast majority of cyclists, does not offer an acceptable safety level. The Highways Agency built cycle tracks alongside the A3, south from Queen Elizabeth Country Park to North Horndean and from Petersfield to Liphook.

The critical section for cyclists, through the Butser Cutting, was left without cycle provision with the loss of the primary cycling route across Hampshire’s South Downs. Over 10 years of campaigning by a large number of cyclists has so far failed to get this unacceptable road design rectified.

However, At a recent meeting with Hampshire County Council staff the Highways Agency agreed to reconsider their objection to a cycle track alongside the dual carriageway, in the Butser Cutting, between the south end of the unused Old A3 and the QE Park entrance. This link would allow the reinstatement of a primary north south cycling route through the South Downs using the now unused Old A3.

The Highway Agency’s more relaxed interpretation of the technical criteria suggests that this is the right time to increase pressure for the reinstatement of the cycle route. The initial action is for a cyclists' petition that you are invited to support.

Please take the time to support this petition which aims to:

*   Maximise the number of cyclists who can cycle across the Hampshire Downs;
*   Enable cycle commuting between the Waterlooville/ Horndean area and Petersfield;
*   Enable cycle access from south of the Downs to Petersfield Railway Station;
*   Improve cycling access from the north onto Butser Hill and into the Queen Elizabeth Forest and the wider South Downs National Park;
*   Improve the safety of those who already cycle along the A3 route;
*   Increase the level of cycling by making additional cycle routes accessible.
