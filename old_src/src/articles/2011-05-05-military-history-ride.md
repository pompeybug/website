OnÂ Sunday 8 May sta[![fort cumberland](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/fort-cumberland1-150x80.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/05/military-history-ride/fort-cumberland-2/)rting at the Square Tower at 11am we will be exploring some of delights of the Military History of Portsmouth. This new and exciting ride will take in historical sights such as Mulberry Harbour, Hilsea Lines, Garrison Church, Southsea Castle and Lumps Fort, Royal Marines Museum, Fort Cumberland and many more.

This ride will visit Portsdown Hill but feel free to walk up or take the Southampton Road and Western Road route to meet us at the other end. Other than a trip up to the Forts on the hill the route is flat and mostly follows cycle routes and quiet roads. We will offer a little talk at each of the stops and aim to finish at 3pm.
