## Report Near Misses!

Examples of a near miss are, being passed too close, another vehicle pulling in or out across a cyclist’s path, being driven at, and a near left or right hook.

This list is not exhaustive however, and what qualifies as a near miss may differ from one cyclist to another – depending on experience and level of confidence. We encourage you to report any incident you feel was a near miss.
