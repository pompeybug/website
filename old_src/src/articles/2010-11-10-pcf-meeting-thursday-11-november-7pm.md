The November meeting of Portsmouth Cycle Forum will include reports from cycling in two other countries - USA and Scotland! Jon Spencer travelled to Chattanooga to find a remarkably cycle-friendly city whilst four other members attended the CTC/Cyclenation conference last weekend in Edinburgh.

We'll also be asking your views on a route across West Southsea complete the Portsmouth's section of the SUSTRANS National Cycle Network Route 2 which runs from Hayling Ferry to Gosport Ferry via Southsea seafront. We'll have some news on cycle parking and an quick update on issues across the city.

All this and more from 7-9pm in meeting room 1 on the 3rd floor at Portsmouth Guildhall. All welcome!
