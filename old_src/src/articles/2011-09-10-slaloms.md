On Sunday 11th September we are meeting at the Guildhall at 10 for a tour around some of the harder to pass features around the city as well as some of worse designed cycle routes. We have some fantastic barriers to cycling in Portsmouth and they aren't all psychological. We'll show you the ones we have found and we'd love to hear about any more that you have discovered around the area.Â  This ride was inspired by a tour around similar lovely features in [Manchester](http://madcyclelanesofmanchester.blogspot.com/2011/06/barriers-bollards-boulders-and-tank.html "manchester ride")
