We have attended a meeting with Colas (the city’s roads contractor) to look at the issues and try to find a way forward so that the needs of cyclists and other vulnerable groups are taken into consideration. Currently you wouldn’t be blamed for not realising that the Government’s new manual for streets emphasises the importance of making travel for pedestrians, cyclists and the disabled as easy and problem free as possible. The blocking of cycle lanes, cycle paths and footpaths by signs and ‘footpath/cycleway closed’ signs and traffic signs that are directed at vehicles is common practice.

So if you are inconvenienced or put in danger by some badly and inconsiderately placed barriers, signs or cones please help.
