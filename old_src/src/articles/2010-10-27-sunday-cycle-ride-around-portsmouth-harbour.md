In response to requests we have another of our popular social rides. On Sunday 31st October we will meet in Victoria Park at 11am for a ride around Portsmouth Harbour.

Everyone is welcome. This is an opportunity to meet other local people and to enjoy a ride and a chat.

We’ll keep as close to the harbour as we can, using off-road routes where possible, although there are some sections along roads.

The route takes us up past the Mountbatten Centre to Hilsea, along the northern edge of harbour through Portchester and Fareham, then down the western edge through Gosport to the ferry. There will be two or three short stops on the way. Don’t forget your ferry fare!

Note: single ferry with bike £3.20
