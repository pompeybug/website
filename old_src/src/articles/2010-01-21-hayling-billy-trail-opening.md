The opening of the new section of the Hayling Billy Trail will take place at Havant Road Langstone, at the junction with Mill Lane, on the 26th Feb 2010 at 10.30 am.

The new path will be opened by David Willets MP, portfolio holder Jenny Wride along with Simon Pratt from Sustrans.

Tea and coffee will be provided at the Sailing Club after the opening with a small display showing future joint cycle improvement and safe routes to school projects that Sustrans, HCC and HBC are intending to carry out within the Borough over the next 18 months.

Please cycle!Â  Failing that use either public transport or walk. Parking will be difficult.
