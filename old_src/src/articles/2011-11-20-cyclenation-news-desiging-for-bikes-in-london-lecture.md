Synopsis

A  cycling revolution has started in London but it is far from finished.&nbsp;  The battle continues between those promoting cycling in the capital and  those who are concerned about the impact on other road users. The  Traffic Management Act (2004) explicitly demands expeditious movement of  traffic and this demand applies to all types of traffic: motor traffic,  cycle traffic and pedestrians.

In  a politically charged environment, the traffic engineer is caught in  the middle with no hard and fast solutions to conflicting demands. This  is where innovation and modern traffic engineering approaches can play a  vital part in ensuring a balance is struck in maximising the capacity  for all types of user, without detrimental impacts on safety. Ali will  be exploring the traffic engineering techniques used in the projects he  is involved with to demonstrate what can be achieved for cycle traffic  in a very congested environment and while minimising impact on other  modes of transport.&nbsp;

&nbsp;Biography

Ali  is a Divisional Director at Jacobs and a past student of the London  South Bank University. He has been with Jacobs since January 2007 with  over 22 years of highways and transportation engineering experience.&nbsp;  His specialism is in sustainable transport, in particular cycling. Ali  has been involved with many cycle infrastructure projects in the UK, and  internationally. He is currently project director for the high profile  London Cycle Superhighways programme awarded to Jacobs. He is an avid  commuter cyclist who has no axe to grind with other modes of transport  as he is also a car driver, public transport user, motorcyclist and  pedestrian, all be it not at the same time!
