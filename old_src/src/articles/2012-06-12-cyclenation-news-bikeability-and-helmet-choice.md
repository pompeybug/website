![Cyclenation Logo](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/wp-cyclenation-news/cnlogo.jpg)<p>Building on our recent seminar, we are also interested in how many Local Authority organised schemes offer a helmet choice.

This is taken from the [Health and Safety policy guidance for Bikeability cycle training](http://www.dft.gov.uk/bikeability/wp-content/uploads/Health_and_Safety_Policy_Guidance.pdf "H and S guidance")....

*   It is recommended that children wear cycle helmets during training. If helmets are worn, instructors may need to adjust them to obtain a better fit.
*   Adults may decide for themselves whether or not to wear a helmet, but instructorsshould explain the benefits and state that the Road Safety Unit recommends that they wear one.

Does you local authority insist on helmet wearing for their bikeability courses? or do they offer a choice?

Take a look at the national[ website ](http://www.dft.gov.uk/bikeability "bikeability")and see if you can find an image that doesn't show cyclists with helmets on.....
