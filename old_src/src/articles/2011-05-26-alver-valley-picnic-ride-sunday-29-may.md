[![Alver Valley Country Park](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Alver-Valley-Country-Park.jpg "Alver Valley Country Park")](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Alver-Valley-Country-Park.jpg)Join us on Bank Holiday Sunday for a family ride to the  Alver Valley Country Park in Gosport.  Much of the  park was originally a landfill site but it is now being transformed into a woodland area by Groundwork Solent. Part of the existing wooded river valley is designated SSSI and with extensive reed beds, is rich in birds, insects and mammals.

We'll meet at The Hard Interchange at 11am to take the ferry to Gosport where we'll follow mainly designated cycle routes.  Bring some food for a picnic and money for the ferry.  We'll return via Stokes Bay to see Gosport's new seafront cycle route and to catch a glimpse of the aircraft carrier USS George H W Bush which will be moored in Stokes Bay.  We plan to be back in Portsmouth by 3pm.

This ride is organised by Portsmouth Cycle Forum in conjunction with Healthy Pompey.
