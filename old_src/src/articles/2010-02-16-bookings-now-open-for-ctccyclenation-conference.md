Bookings are now being accepted for the CTC/Cyclenation Campaign Conference which is being hosted by Portsmouth Cycle Forum on Saturday 17 April 2010.

The theme of the conference will be “Future Cycling Cities”, focussing on how to put cycling at the heart of town and city life. Sharing skills, knowledge and cycling best practise in UK is the core of the Portsmouth conference programme.

The conference will take place in the heart of Portsmouth - a city that could be one of UK’s most inspiring cycling cities.
