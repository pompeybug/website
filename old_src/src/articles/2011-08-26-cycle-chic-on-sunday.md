Dressing up is optional, but for some cycle chic inspiration check out [London cycle chic](http://londoncyclechic.blogspot.com/search/label/Cycle%20fashion%20 "London cycle chic"), [Cycle Chic Sundays](http://www.cyclechicsundays.com/ "Cycle chic sundays"), [Copenhagen cycle chic](http://www.copenhagencyclechic.com/ "copenhagen"), [cycle chic on flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/16nine/sets/72157594400316816/ "flickr") or just google it and take a look.

Ultimately Cycle chic is about riding in everyday clothes rather than helmets or specialist clothes it  is especially prominent in cities, with many bicycle-commuters such as Amsterdam (Netherlands), Basel (Switzerland), Berlin (Germany), Paris (France), Berne (Switzerland), Bristol (England) and Copenhagen (Denmark)

The route for this Sunday's ride will follow mostly quiet residential streets and cycle ways.We start at the Kings Theatre at 11 and will take a leisurely ride around Southsea. On this ride style is all speed is nothing![![](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/vintagebikesald-150x150.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/08/cycle-chic-on-sunday/vintagebikesald/)
