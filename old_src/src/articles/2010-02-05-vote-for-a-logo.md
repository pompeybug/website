Entries for the PCF logo competition have now closed  and voting has opened!

We are looking for a new logo that helps us to attract new members, in particular younger members.  To do this we need a strong, instantly recognisable visual symbol that shows we are a modern, forward thinking organisation that is willing to embrace new ideas.  We would like it to be appreciated by current members of the forum but that is not its primary purpose.

[More guidance on what we need from a logo](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/logos/).

Voting is now closed.
