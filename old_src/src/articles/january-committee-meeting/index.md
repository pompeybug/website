Committee Meeting Summary - January 2021

PCC is asking PCF for input on the Eastern Road cycle facility plans - we discussed our top asks based on suggestions we’ve made over the last ten years, and the suggestions made by members in the two polls we held on our facebook page over Christmas. As well as the actual design, PCF is keen to understand what the diversion route will be whilst works are undertaken.

We discussed that PCC has been awarded funding from the Future High Streets Fund to redesign Commercial Road and Fratton Road - we’ll keep a close eye on this for more details to share with you. 

Just before Christmas we submitted responses to the Local Transport Plan consultation which you can see **[here](https://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/PCF-LTP2036-Consultation-Response.pdf)**.  Overall the LTP was rather good - however, the ambitious content certainly clashes with the actions we have seen over recent years.  We also responded to a planning application for the Debenham’s site in Southsea - also known as Handley’s Corner. The application has done a poor job of assessing the walking and cycling environment so we’re pushing for this to be addressed. 

Our first open meeting in a whole year is planned for 21st January on Zoom - you can book your free place [**here**](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/pcf-open-forum-meeting-tickets-134776292519). We’re really looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible and sharing updates, as well as experiences of cycling over the last year - see you there!
