Our open meeting on Thursday 8 November will be at Eastney Community Centre in Bransbury Road, PO4 9SU.

We will be hearing from Martin Porter and Jan West of Highbury College about their courses in bicycle maintenance   We’ll also be giving a round-up of what we've been doing since we met September and there’ll be plenty of time for discussion on the issues that concern you.

Eastney Community Centre is situated on the edge of Bransbury Park close to the traffic lights at Eastney Road and Devonshire Avenue.

We look forward to seeing you!
