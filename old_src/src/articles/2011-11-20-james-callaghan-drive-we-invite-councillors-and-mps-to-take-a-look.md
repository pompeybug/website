[![view west along james callaghan drive](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/JCD21-300x225.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/11/james-callaghan-drive-we-invite-councillors-and-mps-to-take-a-look/jcd2-2/)You would be forgiven for not immediately recognising the name of James Callaghan Drive, but many of you may have tried to walk or ride along Portsdown Hill Road. As you travel west the hill road changes into James Callaghan Drive and it is one of the scariest roads to ride along in Portsmouth. On the south side you have a [Site of Special Scientific Interest ](http://www.portsdown.hampshire.org.uk/manage.htm "portsdown SSSi")and on the north side, old forts and farmer's fields. Its almost in the countryside - birds are singing - grass, wildlife, trees and flowers are all around you.  Sounds like a lovely place to take the family for a picnic?

Wrong, it is used as an alternative route by people in rapid and often large vehicles that wish to get between Havant and Fareham but would rather not use the Southampton Road or the motorway. The speed limit is 40mph but often people are doing more than that! A vehicle passing you at 40mph is really very frightening especially on an extremely narrow road with no footway at all when you are on a bike, walking or riding a pony or horse. This is especially true if the road is less that 5 m wide for two-way traffic and has bends and undulations that mean the vehicle approaching at speed from the rear cannot see what is coming towards it on the other side.[![portsdown hill road](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Portsdown-Hill-road-300x224.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/11/james-callaghan-drive-we-invite-councillors-and-mps-to-take-a-look/portsdown-hill-road/)

The result is that if you are trying to use the road and you aren't in a vehicle you may have a hair raising time of it with lorries cutting you up, cars swerving towards you to avoid a collision with an on coming vehicle or simply a very impatient person behind you just waiting to take a chance with your life to get passed.

So just imagine you have a disability of any kind and then imagine you want to enjoy the gorgeous countryside on Portsdown Hill and look out over the fabulous views along the hill road, you would not have any opportunity to do so.  Just imagine you have a family and you and an elderly relative want to go out to the countryside and have a nice walk or ride along the hill.  Or maybe you work on the hill and don't want to take a car or you want to visit some of [the interesting places on the hill](http://www.portsdown.hampshire.org.uk/places.htm "FOPH website") like the Peter Ashley Centre, the Equestrian Centre or the forts. You'll have negotiate the busy road first, then make your way along the narrow and lumpy verge, if there is one, trying not to trip into the road. This is not for the faint hearted!

However, all of this could be changed and the area opened up to many more visitors and families if a simple amendment was made..... create a multi-user hard wearing path on the northern side of the road that bikes, walkers, the disabled and horses can all use easily, like [the billy trail](http://hampshire.walkandcycle.co.uk/trail_details.php?recordID=HAMPTR0041 "the billy trail"), made of compacted gravel maybe. There must be a material that would be suitable for all to use?

[![portsdown hill](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/portsdown-hill-150x150.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/11/james-callaghan-drive-we-invite-councillors-and-mps-to-take-a-look/portsdown-hill-2/)Then we can promote this as somewhere that visitors and residents can go to have a family day out, [![portsdown hill](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/portsdown-hill-2-150x120.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/11/james-callaghan-drive-we-invite-councillors-and-mps-to-take-a-look/portsdown-hill-2-2/)enjoy the view, walk or ride along the hill looking out over Portsmouth or the fields and the downs in the distance the other way. This simple solution is better value for money and more beneficial to all types of road users, especially the vulnerable ones, than the majority of the projects funded last year by the council.

We are inviting all ward Councillors and MPs to come and meet us there on 25th November at 8.30 am  (although the traffic is fairly non-stop all day) to judge for themselves and formulate their own opinions on what it is like along this road if you aren't 'protected' by a metal casing. Come along too and support us, or just express you point of view. If you can't make it write a quick email to your [councillor and MP](http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/yourcouncil/councillors-and-MPs.html "councillors and MPs")
