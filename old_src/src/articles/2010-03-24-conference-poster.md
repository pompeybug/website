Here is a poster for the upcoming [CTC/Cyclenation](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/conference/) conference we are hosting.  The poster is A4 sized for easy printing and has details of all the highlights of the conference programme.  It is in PDF format for you to download and print - put them up wherever you can so that people will see them.

There is a booking form on the reverse so print some out and give them to all your cycling buddies.
