Do you cycle in Portsmouth?

Do you ever resort to chaining your bike to railings, trees, streetlights etc. because there is no convenient cycle parking?

We've been asked by the leader of the Council, Gerald Vernon-Jackson, to come up with a list of 30 sites for secure bicycle parking in the city.

By "secure" we understand that Sheffield type stands are intended and these can be in groups or ones and twos or more - near shops, restaurants, community centres, schools, stations, houses&hellip;

So, please tell us where you'd like to see bicycle parking and we'll feed the information back to Portsmouth City Council.
