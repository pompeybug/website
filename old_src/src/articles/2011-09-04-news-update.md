## Open meeting this Thursday - 8 September

[![](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Eastern-Road-congestion-picture2-150x150.jpg "Eastern Road congestion picture")](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Eastern-Road-congestion-picture2.jpg)Everyone is welcome to our open meeting this Thursday the 8th September at 7pm. We have two guest speakers from Portsmouth City Council who will be talking about the Local Transport Plan 3 implementation plan and the [Eastern Road Congestion Relief scheme](http://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/living/21986.html "Eastern Road Congestion Relief Sheme") with a focus on the implications for cyclists and pedestrians. Chris will be giving us an update on the Community Cycle Centre. We’d like to hear about your experiences of cycling around Portsmouth too, if you’ve got any issues maybe we can help.

## A Frames and Slaloms ride coming up - 11 September

On Sunday 11th September we are meeting at the Guildhall at 10 for a tour around some of the harder to pass features around the city. We have some fantastic barriers to cycling in Portsmouth and they aren't all psychological. We'll show you the ones we have found and we'd love to hear about any more that you have discovered around the area.  This ride was inspired by a tour around similar lovely features in [Manchester](http://madcyclelanesofmanchester.blogspot.com/2011/06/barriers-bollards-boulders-and-tank.html "manchester ride")

## Fish and Chip ride - 25 September

We are also planning another of our popular fish and chip rides, you don't even have to eat fish to enjoy it, [![Fishy Friday Cycle Ride](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/fish-and-chip-shop-sign-150x150.jpg)](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/2011/06/bike-week-2011-fishy-friday-bike-ride/fish-and-chip-shop-sign/)several regular attendees don't! This time we are going Gosport_wards_ to enjoy our feast at Lee overlooking the Solent. The ride begins at the Hard at 11 on Sunday 25th September and the ferry costs around £4.
