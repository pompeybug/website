[![Olympic legacy](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/olympic_legacy_children_playing_in_olympic_rings-300x168.jpg "olympic_legacy_children_playing_in_olympic_rings")](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/olympic_legacy_children_playing_in_olympic_rings.jpg)Our open meeting on 13 September will be at the Stacey Community Centre in Walsall Road Copnor PO3 6DN near St Mary's Hospital. This is also home to the [Community Cycle Centre](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/community-cycle-centre/ "Community") where pre-owned bicycles are donated, refurbished and made available to anyone for a small donation to cover costs. The CCC will be open for inspection and Chris will give a short overview of the project.

Also on the agenda will be a reflection on the legacy of the Olympics and what it could mean for cycling in Portsmouth.  We'll also be giving a round-up of what we've been doing since we met at Wiggle last July.

**Directions to the Stacey Centre**: From the roundabout on Milton Road (north of St Mary's Hospital), take the Langstone Road exit. Then take the 2nd left (Lichfield Road, then first right (Walsall Road).  You'll find the community centre building on the left.  Secure bicycle parking will be available outside.

We look forward to seeing you!
