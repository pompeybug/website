We take a tour of Portsea Island, taking in Old Portsmouth, the seafront, Langstone Harbour and the Hilsea Lines.  All on cycle tracks or quiet streets, mostly national cycle network.  There is one footbridge we have to get off and carry bikes over.  Bring a snack and drink to keep you going!  Meet 10am at Gosport ferry.  Starts at 10:00, duration is 04:30 hours.
