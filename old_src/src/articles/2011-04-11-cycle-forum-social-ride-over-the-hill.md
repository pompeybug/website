We celebrate the longer evenings on **Thursday 14 April** with a cycle ride which will take us to the top of Portsdown Hill and a beyond. Following mostly quiet roads and cycle routes, we'll cycle all the way up Portsdown, then down and back up again. Make sure your gears and brakes are in good order – and bring lights and a drink.   **Meet in the Guildhall Square at 5.15 pm**. We aim to be back by 8pm.
