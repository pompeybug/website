Most of you will have noticed by now that the first phase of the seafront cycle route is being built - indeed a long stretch of it is all but complete.  You will also noticed that there has been considerable criticism of the route in the local press.  It is vitally important that we show Portsmouth City Council how popular this route is  - otherwise there is a great risk that the decision makers will get cold feet when asked to approve phase 2.  **Therefore could we please ask all of you to write to Simon Moon, head of traffic and transportation at Portsmouth City Council expressing support for the seafront cycle route**.

If you are not sure what to write or are short of time then we have created a form with which you can automatically email Simon Moon.  [Click here to find it](../infrastructure/support-the-seafront-cycle-route/).

However, a unique letter or email always has more impact so if you have time to write one Simon Moon's Contact details are:

Simon Moon
Portsmouth City Council
Civic Offices
Guildhall Square
Portsmouth
Hampshire, PO1 2BG
