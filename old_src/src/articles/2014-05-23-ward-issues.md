<td width="158">**Baffins**</td>
<td width="272">Cycle access to St Marys via Guardian Gate</td>
<td width="751">Milton Road is a busy road with no cycle provision. Cycle access to St Mary’s hospital is difficult, if not unsafe for many cyclists.     An alternative route is needed, connecting St Marys Road with Fratton Way and the rear of the hospital (as existed until recently). In the meantime creating a shared cycle/footpath would ensure cyclists’ safety.</td>

<td width="272">Safe route to Portsmouth College on Tangier Road</td>
<td width="751">Tangier Road is a key route from central parts of the city to Portsmouth College. There is a short length of cycle lane close to the college but parking along a large part of the road forces cyclists into the path of following vehicles, creating potential conflict and danger.     Marked cycle lanes each side would at least alert motorists to the presence of cyclists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Central Southsea**</td>
<td width="272">Parking on Goldsmith Ave cycle lanes</td>
<td width="751">Goldsmith Avenue is a key route on the city’s cycle network with cycle lanes marked along a large part. Despite yellow lines, illegal parking on the cycle lanes is not enforced. An interim remedy would be to mark solid white lines to indicate ‘do not cross’ as well as enforcement. A future solution would be to install a segregated two-way cycle track on the north side, similar to the seafront.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Safe routes to Priory School</td>
<td width="751">Priory School is within cycling distance for a large number of its students. However, it is surrounded by heavily-trafficked roads and residential streets full of parked cars. More effort should be made to create attractive, safe cycle routes. Urgent attention should be given to improving the crossings on Victoria Road North, where fast traffic is approaching or exiting the roundabout.     In future a network of safe marked routes should be created from other parts of Central Southsea and Fratton.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Charles Dickens**</td>
<td width="272">City Centre North cycle access</td>
<td width="751">Currently there is poor provision for cycling into the city centre from all areas, but particularly from the north and east. The lack of north-south and east-west routes leads to conflict in the pedestrianised areas. The plans for City Centre North show some improvements but involve multiple crossings over a relatively short distance. Additional improvements are needed to increase access from Landport/Buckland areas as well through routes. The major route along Marketway is too narrow and has blind bends.     Any upgrade to the road network must allow sufficient width to bring the cycleway up to standard.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">The Hard shared space</td>
<td width="751">Currently there are cycle lanes marked on The Hard but these are frequently blocked by vehicles, despite the double yellow lines. The Cycle Forum acknowledges that the redevelopment plans for The Hard show improvements for cycling but any measures such as marked cycle lanes need to be enforced. In addition allowance needs to be made for cycling into the transport interchange from both directions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Copnor**</td>
<td width="272">Copnor Road parking</td>
<td width="751">Copnor Road is a major artery in the city for all traffic. In the absence of alternative routes from the north to the southeast of the city, this road needs to be made more attractive to cyclists. Parking along a large part of the road forces cyclists into the path of following vehicles, creating potential conflict and danger. Marked cycle lanes each side would at least alert motorists to the presence of cyclists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Safe routes to Mayfield School</td>
<td width="751">Mayfield School is within cycling distance for a large number of its students. However, it is surrounded by heavily-trafficked roads and residential streets full of parked cars. More effort should be made to create attractive, safe cycle routes. In future a network of safe marked routes should be created from other parts of Copnor and the north of the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Cosham**</td>
<td width="272">Safe routes to Highbury College</td>
<td width="751">Highbury college is within cycling distance for a large number of its students.     However, it is accessible only by crossing some busy roads. Existing infrastructure such as the A27 cycle/footbridge should be more clearly signposted, as well as the route from Cosham station. In future a network of safe marked routes should be created from other parts of Cosham and the north of the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Safe routes to QA</td>
<td width="751">Currently there are no marked cycle routes directly into QA Hospital. Southampton Road has poorly maintained cycle paths, shared with pedestrians, but no route is marked, even from Cosham centre. It may not be practical to expect visitors or staff to cycle from home but certainly a clearly defined route from the railway station is possible and desirable.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Drayton &amp; Farlington**</td>
<td width="272">Safe routes to Springfield School</td>
<td width="751">Springfield School is within cycling distance for a large number of its students. However, it is surrounded by busy roads and residential streets full of parked cars. More effort should be made to create attractive, safe cycle routes.     In future a network of safe marked routes should be created from other parts of Drayton &amp; Farlington.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Farlington Ave calming</td>
<td width="751">Traffic calming measures were applied at the top of Farlington Avenue to slow traffic down, but what should have made the road safer has endangered cyclists. Going downhill, cyclists have been given a ‘cut-through’ to avoid the chicane, whereas going uphill, cyclists are forced into the chicane, in the path of following cars. There is adequate space on either side to allow a cut-through for cyclists, and we asked Portsmouth City Council to modify the scheme at the time it was proposed.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Eastney &amp; Craneswater**</td>
<td width="272">South Parade Pier safe cycle route</td>
<td width="751">While the seafront cycle route may not have been universally popular, even among cyclists, on a summer day it is busy with families and groups of older children.     Now that there is a marked cycling/walking route across Southsea Common, it is vital that a safe route next to South Parade Pier is installed to complete the seafront cycle route.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Parking on Albert Road cycle lane</td>
<td width="751">Cycle lanes have been marked on Albert Road, albeit with long gaps. Despite yellow lines, illegal parking on the cycle lanes is not enforced, and is especially bad near to traffic lights. Such parking forces cyclists into the path of following vehicles, creating potential conflict and danger. Excessive parking and throughflow of traffic discourages shoppers from spending more time on Albert Road. An extension of the ‘shared space’ by the Kings Theatre would make a more pedestrian and cycle-friendly environment.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Fratton**</td>
<td width="272">Fratton Road traffic lights – green wave</td>
<td width="751">The numerous traffic lights on Fratton Road/Kingston Road make for stop-start journeys for all road users, but they encourage drivers to speed up before the lights change, endangering pedestrians and cyclists. Setting lights to red until a vehicle approaches would avoid this danger, and giving cyclists 5-10 seconds start with their own signals also reduces potential conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Safe routes to City Girls School</td>
<td width="751">City Girls School is within cycling distance for a large number of its students.     However, it is surrounded by busy roads and residential streets full of parked cars. More effort should be made to create attractive, safe cycle routes. In future a network of safe marked routes should be created from other parts of the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Hilsea**</td>
<td width="272">Shared access Peronne Road northbound</td>
<td width="751">Peronne Road leads to the shared cycle/footbridge over the A27 into Cosham and Highbury College and is an ideal quiet route for cyclists. However, the busy one-way system where Copnor Road and London Road meet is not cycle-friendly. Creating a wide shared cycle/footpath between Peronne Road and Norway Road would allow throughflow of cyclists between Cosham, Hilsea and Copnor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Narrow shared path on Portsbridge</td>
<td width="751">The cycle paths around Portsbridge roundabout are a vital part of the Portsmouth cycle network, connecting the western side of Portsea Island with the rest of the city and beyond. At several points there are bottlenecks where two cyclists can barely pass safely, regardless of other users of the paths. Space is available around the roundabout to create a safe shared route for pedestrians and cyclists. PCC has previously proposed these improvements but no change has been made.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Milton**</td>
<td width="272">Tesco Fratton Way cycle access</td>
<td width="751">When the Fratton Way retail park was built space was allocated for cycling, segregated from traffic and footpaths. The proposed Tesco store provides an opportunity to encourage a wide uptake in cycling into and around the development, thus reducing the probable traffic congestion around the store. However, proposed improvements during the consultation have become less clear with the outline planning application. To encourage cycling, dedicated cycle paths to and around the store are needed, including on Milton Lane and across Fratton Way.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">St James Hospital right of way</td>
<td width="751">Walking and cycling is permitted through St James Hospital grounds, although it is not designated as a public right of way. This is an attractive route between Locksway Road and Moorings Way, and our concern is that redevelopment of the site will reduce or remove through access. We ask for support to apply for a public right of way through the grounds.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Nelson**</td>
<td width="272">Twyford Avenue cycle lanes</td>
<td width="751">Cycle lanes marked on Stamshaw Road and Twyford Avenue are very narrow, passing very close to parked cars, with the danger from doors opening. There should be proper enforcement to prevent vehicles blocking cycle lanes. If residents’ parking schemes are to be extended in this area, consideration should be given to removing some of the parking spaces, or moving them away from conflict with cyclists.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Park+Ride cycle access</td>
<td width="751">Many millions have been spent on the Park and Ride at Tipner, and we hope this is a success in reducing congestion coming into the city centre. Folding bikes are available to hire to encourage visitors to see more of the city, but there are no clearly defined cycle routes from here. Routes to the City Centre, Cosham and the Mountbatten Centre should be created to encourage cycle use.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**Paulsgrove**</td>
<td width="272">Tipner-Port Solent link</td>
<td width="751">Plans for development at Port Solent and Tipner indicate a bus-only bridge to be built linking the two communities. Reference is made to allowing cycling, but the design should give segregated space for pedestrians and cyclists to avoid conflict.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Safe routes to QA</td>
<td width="751">Currently there are no marked cycle routes directly into QA Hospital. Southampton Road has poorly maintained cycle paths, shared with pedestrians, but no route is marked, even from Cosham or Paulsgrove.     In future a network of safe marked routes should be created from other parts of the north of the city.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**St Jude**</td>
<td width="272">Safe route from city centre</td>
<td width="751">There are numerous marked cycle routes in Portsmouth, but surprisingly none of them link the two main shopping centres of Southsea and the City Centre. To encourage more visitors to the Southsea shops and seafront, a quiet route should be marked from Portsmouth and Southsea railway station.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Parking on Elm Grove cycle lanes</td>
<td width="751">Cycle lanes are marked on Elm Grove, albeit with long gaps. Despite yellow lines, illegal parking on the cycle lanes is not enforced, and is especially bad close to traffic lights. Such parking forces cyclists into the path of following vehicles, creating potential conflict and danger. Excessive parking and throughflow of traffic discourages shoppers from spending more time on Elm Grove.   Improvements such as giving cyclists 5-10 seconds start with their own signals also reduces potential conflict at busy junctions.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">**St Thomas**</td>
<td width="272">Safe routes to University</td>
<td width="751">The main University campus is within cycling distance for most of its students. A large number of students live close to the main east-west route along Winston Churchill Avenue, but this is poorly marked, with a number of busy junctions such as Victoria Road North and Cambridge Road. Other safe routes from Kings Road area would make cycling a more attractive means of travel. In future a network of safe marked routes should be created from other parts of the city to the University.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="158">** **</td>
<td width="272">Safe route to seafront</td>
<td width="751">PCC has created a cycle route across Southsea Common to the Seafront and South Parade Pier, linking with the popular segregated cycle track east of the pier, but this is not complete. A safe cycling route linking the Seafront with Old Portsmouth and The Hard Interchange would encourage more residents and visitors to leave their cars at home, reducing congestion on busy days.</td>
