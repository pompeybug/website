We're off for a ride to Rowlands Castle on Sunday morning.

Meeting at the Good Companions at the bottom of the Eastern Road at 10 and picking up at Farlington Marshes at 10.30.

As with all the rides, we will be progressing at the speed that suits all riders so we won't leave anyone behind and don't forget, you can always get the train back if you want.

Join us for this social ride and meet some other people that like to ride too. We'll be stopping at the cafe in the village or bring a picnic for the green.

Looking forward to seeing you there.

If you prefer a gentler ride, why not join Gill, Pam and friends for the** WEDNESDAY MORNING BIKE RIDE** Meet at Stacey Centre, Walsall Rd from 10 am

Rides will start at 10.30, last for about 2 hours and include a stop for coffee â€¦
