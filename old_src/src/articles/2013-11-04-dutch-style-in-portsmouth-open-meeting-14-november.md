The next open meeting of Portsmouth Cycle Forum will take place at 7pm on Thursday 14 November 2013 upstairs at the Student’s Union (room SEM 5) on Cambridge Road - click [here](http://goo.gl/ZlVwOI "University of Portsmouth Student") for a map.

We will be discussing how Dutch ideas for cycle infrastructure could work in Portsmouth. The Dutch city of Groningen is a compact city of about 200,000 people (just like Portsmouth) that in the 1970’s made a number of revolutionary planning decisions that now result in this city having the highest rate of cycle use in the world.

If you’d like to see better facilities for cyclists in Portsmouth and more people cycling then please come along. All are welcome.
