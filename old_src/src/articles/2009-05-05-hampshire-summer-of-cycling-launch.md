Scores of cyclists rode to Gunwharf Quays to visit Portsmouth Cycle Forum's Giant cycling map on Bank Holiday Saturday.

Cyclists were of all ages and included fit pensioners and families with helmeted toddlers.

They plotted the worst danger spots around the city, shared their favourite routes and stories of adventure, and fitness gained.

The lean pensioners were evidence of the health benefits of pushing pedals. Members of the Forum heard of local cycle trips to the shops, to work and to places all over the world - well off the beaten track.
