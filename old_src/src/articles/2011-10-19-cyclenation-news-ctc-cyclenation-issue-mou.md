![Cyclenation Logo](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/plugins/wp-cyclenation-news/cnlogo.jpg)<p>The CTC and Cyclenation have issued a Memorandum of Understanding and it can be read [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z_sZk7XAjtLY0R0V-Or-UT847teqYbYU8NgYqtWWyyQ/edit?hl=en_US).

Cyclenation Secretary Simon Geller said "Cyclenation groups have lots of energy and enthusiasm, but up to now we have found it difficult to support their efforts. With this new agreement we will be able to bring additional resources to bear to help our members get to grips with the Government agendas of Localism and the Big Society. We have always worked closely with the CTC and the MOU will help to cement this relationship whilst strongly reinforcing the autonomy of both our organizations."
