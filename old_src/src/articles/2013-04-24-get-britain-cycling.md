The All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group (APPCG) released their Get Britain Cycling report today.  The report follows a six-week long inquiry hosted by the APPCG at the Palace of Westminster earlier this year calls for 10% of all journeys in Britain to be made by bike by 2025.  Some of the headline recommendations made to enable this goal include:

*   More of the transport budget should be spent on supporting cycling, at a rate initially set to at least £10 per person per year, and increasing as cycling levels increase
*   Cycling should be considered at an earlier stage in all planning decisions, whether transport schemes or new houses or businesses
*   More use should be made of segregated cycle lanes, learning from the Dutch experience
*   Urban speed limits should generally be reduced to 20 mph
*   Just as children learn to swim at school they should learn to ride a bike
*   The Government should produce a detailed cross-departmental Cycling Action Plan, with annual progress reports.
The summary and recommendations of the report can be read here: [Get Britain Cycling Summary &amp; Recommendations](http://www.pompeybug.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/Get-Britain-Cycling-Summary-Recommendations-copy.pdf "Get Britain Cycling Summary &amp; Recommendations").
