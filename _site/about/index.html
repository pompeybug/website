  <article>
    <p>Portsmouth Cycle Forum is an award winning, independent, volunteer led cycle campaign group representing close to 450 members and the needs of people who already cycle, or would like to cycle in our city for their everyday journeys.</p>
<p>Our vision - set out in A City To Share (launched Nov 2015) and since adopted by Portsmouth City Council - is that Portsmouth becomes the pre-eminent cycling city of the UK and:</p>
<p><strong>A city fit for the future:</strong> a healthy, safe, sustainable, prosperous city that people want to live in, to work in and to visit. A city where we share spaces, co-operate with each other and treat one another with courtesy and respect.</p>
<p><strong>A safer city</strong><br>
People of all ages will feel protected and respected on the roads and safe to travel independently within the city.</p>
<p><strong>Improved health outcomes</strong><br>
People will be healthier for longer with reduced obesity levels and reduced strain on local health services. The number and severity of accidents on the road will be substantially reduce bringing further benefits.</p>
<p><strong>A stronger local economy</strong><br>
Cycling will favour the use of local businesses rather than large out of town centres. Less congestion with increased transport capacity will benefit businesses across the city.</p>
<p><strong>A better environment</strong><br>
A reduction in the volume of traffic will reduce the primary source of air pollution in the city. This will bring further benefits to the health of all and prevent many early deaths. There will also be benefits from the reduced carbon footprint of our low-lying city.</p>
<p><strong>A fairer, more livable city</strong><br>
A shift in transport away from the dominance of the road infrastructure by the private motor vehicle to cycling and walking will deliver benefits to the whole city, not just to those who cycle.</p>
<p><strong>The Committee</strong></p>
<p>Our committee is a lovely, friendly bunch of volunteers who spend their free time campaigning for better cycle infrastructure for our city. We have a lot of fun too so if you fancy joining the committee – or just trying it out, get in touch at <a href="mailto:info@pompeybug.co.uk">info@pompeybug.co.uk</a></p>

<p>I have over 40 years experience of cycling on UK roads, and so have seen many changes since the 1980s! I want my kids to have the same confidence and ability to cycle around with friends or to events that I had, hence my desire to improve the conditions for cyclists in the city.</p>
<p>My role on the committee is to keep an eye on infrastructure and network issues.  Predominantly this is concerned with the various projects the City Council are developing through engagement meetings, consultation responses and occasionally deputations at decisions meetings. Additionally Traffic Regulation Orders also need to be studied to ensure that other maintenance and service provisions do not mean people currently cycling around the city are put at increased risk of danger through temporary works.</p>

<p>Phil is a leisure cyclist turned commuter who wants safe, direct routes. He also owns a cargo bike to minimise the use of his car.</p>

<p>Holding up the side for the girls! I volunteer with PCF because I want cycling to be easier for everyone. I want to see our streets transformed into more friendly and healthy places where kids can play and people can get around, doing normal day to day things on their feet, bikes and by public transport. This won’t happen if people are too scared to get on their bikes; so I campaign for better infrastructure. I work as a transport planner, specialising in walking, cycling, data, and public health and use my bike for normal things, like doing the shopping; seeing my friends; and riding into the city centre from just outside the city where I now live. I help out with bike rides (like the “famous women of Portsmouth ride”), website updates (like this page) and responding to Council transport plans.</p>

<p>Back in 2006 I was one of the original four founders of the independent Portsmouth Cycle Forum.  I'm a regular commuter cyclist and also a determined campaigner to improve Portsmouth's sub-standard cycle infrastructure, poor road safety record and illegally high levels of air pollution.  Over the years I've gained a lot of technical knowledge about the design of cycle facilities, Dept. for Transport regulations, Highways England standards, road safety requirements and the legal aspects of cycling.  I provide comment on PCC transport plans.</p>
<p>I firmly believe that if the Council did more to encourage people to use public transport and make Portsmouth's roads safe for cyclists then fewer people would feel a need to drive and we would have a cleaner city with a healthier population.</p>

<p>After taking a job in Portsmouth in 2015 and getting fed up sitting in vehicular traffic, I now cycle commute nearly every day from the Waterlooville area into Portsmouth for work (and sometimes Gosport/Chichester), and sold my car as it was sitting unused on the drive.</p>
<p>Although I started as a leisure rider back in the day, nowadays I really only ride for utility (transport/shopping etc), although as my kids get older we’re slowly extending their legs, getting them into longer leisure rides around the area (including the New Forest and QECP) and wants a city that is safe for his kids, their friends, and indeed everyone to be able to enjoy the independance, freedom and other benefits delivered through the provision of a network of high quality, safe, active travel (walking/wheeling/cycling) infrastructure.</p>
<p>I like diving into data to ensure I'm making evidence based decisions, and can often be found in a pub garden  (or even better camping in a field) somewhere with an ale in hand, talking over the latest research with like minded individuals. This approach carries through to my approach to campaigning for more space for active travel across Portsmouth, Hampshire, and beyond.</p>

<p>I am a mum of two and a proud owner of a cargo bike which replaces our car for daily travel around the city. I joined Portsmouth Cycle Forum to help campaign for a safe, inclusive cycle infrastructure which would be suitable for people of all ages and abilities. I am also interested in making cities more child friendly.</p>
